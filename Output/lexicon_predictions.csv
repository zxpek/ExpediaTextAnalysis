Positive,Thanks for your prompt reply. DM just sent.
Negative,"Thanks. I'll forward you the correspondence and DM you now. I can't believe he works for Expedia, his emails are harassing!"

Neutral,"@ExpediaUK hello, why haven't my points from when I booked Paris in May active on my account yet?"
Positive,@ExpediaUK this woman's story is interesting but her voice is lacklustre: e.g. don't actually BELIEVE her when she says sh can't wait to...

Negative,"@ExpediaUK Hi. Just booked hotel in Brighton, UK. I chose book now, pay later. Can you confirm that my card hasn't been charged? Thank you."
Neutral,Have done. Will I have to go through everything again?
Positive,"Hello, still no resolution. Clearly yourselves and budget oversell this stock and they have no capability to fulfill. Really poor service"
Neutral,Why should I have to waste my time calling your support team for something you should be able to do online? I booked online after all?!
Neutral,Yes but that was a search which was carried out within 2 minutes of each other yesterday evening!
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK hi, just made an avtivities booking on your website. But didnt have an option to enter the local20 discount code. 1/2"

Positive,That's great - can you confirm that I shouldn't rebook and you will change the booked name?
Positive,Thank you. I have also dm'd the information too. Thank you x
Neutral,"I went onto expedia to book Â£850 trip, you screwed it up so ended up booking with @Opodo_UK & deactivating my expedia account. Good job."

Negative,"It is the exact same flight from London and the exact same vegas hotel at the exact same time, just a ridiculous Â£213 extra to fly Belfast"
Negative,@ExpediaUK why is a holiday from Belfast almost Â£213 more expensive than if I fly from Dublin? Same @British_Airways flights. Bit extreme..

Neutral,@ExpediaUK Charged my account a different amount to invoice/amount in confirmation email and name of company on my statement was NOT Expedia

Neutral,@ExpediaUK Hi I've tried finding how to cancel my hotel reservation but I can't see anything. Can u cancel res 7258010310402 please?
Negative,@ExpediaUK Really shocked that you sell tickets without displaying the T&C. Assumptions that it's non refundable doesn't cut it.
Positive,1/2 I would like to confirm if breakfast is included to my hotel? I'm pretty much sure that at the time of booking...
Neutral,"2/2 ...it said that ""breakfast included"" in the amenities section. However, it doesn't show anywhere in my booking confirmation?"
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK Hi, can I please confirm something via DM? Thanks :)"
Neutral,"something given or supplied without charge, as lodging, transportation or meals especially as an inducement to prospective customers"
Negative,Certain adverts are misleading and unethical. I think you need to educate yourselves & review your use of the term complimentary- see no 2!
Negative,"It's ruined what will be our first trip to Dubai, I don't even want to go now "
Neutral,@ExpediaUK any deals you could do from Newcastle - Orlando at Christmas time?
Negative,@ExpediaUK the number you have just provided me is for your Banglore/India call centre...... Are you all completely incompetent?
Negative,@ExpediaUK Shocking customer service! (AGAIN)!!! Have you got a UK call centre I can speak to regarding this.
Neutral,I have sent the details to you by DM.
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK hi, have you stop selling tickets to Sea World San Diego? Thanks Ian"
Negative,@ExpediaUK How long does it take to get a response to an emailed complaint? Sent 1 via ur website & no reply!
Neutral,Also rather not have to call a uk call centre from Germany....
Neutral,I'm at the hotel now though so I need it looking into before breakfast starts tommorow morning
Positive,@ExpediaUK hey guys. How do I find out what's included in my room fare? Im positive that I paid for brekkie but the hotel said I haven't?
Negative,"@ExpediaUK trying to book a hotel on your site, get to payment page then keeps saying booking failed, try again in a few minutes - help!?!"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK just got back from my holiday and the hotel we booked for three adults showed three beds. We got there and there was two beds?
Neutral,Not possible to send you DM
Negative,I think it is wrong you are advertising deals you are not honouring. I've even offered to pay the additional costs...........
Neutral,Can you book my holiday as you are advertising that it is available. Your call centres in Banglor India have not been able to do anything
Neutral,@ExpediaUK absolute joke of a company. They like to advertise good deals which jump up in cost when you go to book it. Really poor service 2
Neutral,@ExpediaUK have a holiday booked through your site; flying with air france; what baggage allowance are we allowed to have each!
Negative,"@ExpediaUK you advertised misleading/false promo on your website,I have booked it and have been told it will not be honoured or refunded "
Negative,Should reflect what I'm complaining about?
Neutral,But why a coupon for a holiday? If it's either a hotel or holiday why not a flight? It makes no sense? Especially when the compensation
Neutral,"Why though? Because I got the voucher because I'd bought flights through you, so a holiday voucher is pretty useless"
Negative,Yes and they have said its my dads problem. Really misleading at the point of booking and the cost of recovering the service is minimal
Negative,@ExpediaUK Disappointing service after booking a flight with you for my parents and disgraceful after care with complaint  Can you help?
Neutral,"No, i want to email so please provide that address."
Neutral,Well it is right and over on the phone couldnt get me a new hotel. How do i raise a complaint?
Neutral,@ExpediaUK after confirming a booking i was then emailed while just outside the hotel to say that there was no longer space for me.
Neutral,"Now after sending a detailed DM regarding flight changes etc, you send me THIS reply"
Negative,I have called @ExpediaUK and been given wrong advice which has now cost me Â£Â£Â£ 
Positive,Well I'm wondering if the flight British airways have failed to refund me on can be exchanged with another flight of the same route?
Neutral,Thank you. I have messaged you with that info.
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK @Hertz has issued you a refund for a car rental that was denied to us, could you pass it on? We have emailed you asking for it."
Neutral,It's not a name correction as its very clear on my passport that you can see it and I've explained to Etihad airways as well!!!! 
Neutral,#PicShown
Neutral,@ExpediaUK @EtihadAirways 
Negative,"I have sent you formal complaints via your website, over the phone, looking to get this matter investigated!!"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK we have an issue we would like to discuss 00:27 28/06
Neutral,2/2 has it been advertised all day at Â£33? And in fact still IS advertised at Â£33?
Positive,1/2 If the Â£33 room is no longer available because the payment page says Â£89 (thus suggesting the database has updated) then why...
Neutral,That just seems like an excuse to advertise low prices whenever you want (and for however long you want) but charge more at the payment page
Positive,"@ExpediaUK What's the best way to talk to someone about editing a hotel booking, please?"
Positive,"Amazing, will do! Thank you"
Neutral,Last night we were going to pay Â£437.90
Negative,"Is that a no? It was an error message that was at the last stage of payment, I can send you the screenshots as proof"

Neutral,Any explanation from expedia on this issue is highly appreciated.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Hi called oman air to change seats advised to call expedia as I booked through you? Please advise?
Positive,i have done x3 and they told me nothing showing on expedia a/c. @AskNationwide and @mbna have confirmed no issues with the cards i'd tried.
Neutral,not using 3rd party site and certainly not authorising lithium to use my twitter account
Negative,@ExpediaUK all day trying to book for 5 adults to IST. worst experience of my life. payments not working. tried 2 credit cards #badcustexp
Neutral,@ExpediaUK your Customer Service is a joke and we are just want to enjoy our honeymoon we booked over 6 mths ago.!
Neutral,I also realised that now. Just wandering why Expedia will offer me this type of room for 4 persons. I did not change anything while booking
Positive,I know Expedia through whom I booked. I m not interested in hotel policy. If it is error from expedia then they should compensate
Negative,"@ExpediaUK  â?? any way I can switch off those annoying ""how many people are viewing"" banners on every page?"
Neutral,It's been sent.
Neutral,"I just attempted to send a DM, however it says the account does not accept DMs"
Positive,@ExpediaUK - Just booked a hotel with you 40 minutes ago and your website gave me no option to cancel! Not very user friendly!
Neutral,can you follow me so that I can DM you please? Won't let me DM you otherwise. Thanks.
Negative,"Stop giving rubbish responses! Yes or no, is this your site advertising a room at this hotel for Â£15? #expedia #hotels #fakeprices"

Neutral,@ExpediaUK Booked hotel for Â£1400 & Expedia charged me twice. Nearly 10 calls later I'm no closer to a refund. Sort it out please Expedia.
Negative,@ExpediaUK many thx to your cust serv agent who changed our booking without question following my husband's cancer diagnosis. He's a star
Neutral,Please do. It was VERY frustrating as it happened 3 times. Feel free to contact for further details. I used to test software.
Positive,"@ExpediaUK not once was the details of my booking checked. I now have proof of the false adv, and was just given a rubbish response. (2/2)"
Negative,@ExpediaUK i have been emailing your customer services since last week receing very poor responses. Making out i was wrong 1/2

Neutral,"@ExpediaUK H, I want to look hotel+flight to Zakynthos with @British_Airways. Will I have yo pay for baggage/checked bags separately?"
Negative,@ExpediaUK just booked and tried to add Nectar card but it said there was an error and to email. Why can't I add my card for the points?
Neutral,"I have now, they told me to email a screenshot which I did. If it's not resolved by Friday I will get bank to reverse it as I can't pay it."

Neutral,It's maddan that's flying not me please respond to him
Negative,"@ExpediaUK I have booked the holiday with you and @qatarairways is in my itinerary.Due to current #Qatar issue, i m unable to know what 2 do"
Negative,@ExpediaUK life is stressful as it is... pls don't add to it...
Negative,@ExpediaUK How about dealing with the complaint I sent you via your website 3 weeks ago?
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Hi I have a booking and tried to upgrade flight to be told it will cost Â£763 Why? Other Airlines it costs Â£60. It is  BA flight ?
Negative,@ExpediaUK Priority Reference Number: 28479967 (ref: 28479967). Pls sort & get beach apartment as explained before. The is matter unresolved
Positive,"@ExpediaUK  When are you going to deal with issues. It goes to India centre, and though friendly on the phone there is no resolution Why"
Positive,Thank you for your swift reply and info. I will call the number you provided.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Can you help? 'Yeovil Cultural awareness' needs postcards from around the world. Send to- The Town House Yeovil. England BA20 1PQ
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK hi, I can't seem to search for flights only when I want to use a nectar voucher?? Terms say I can use it for pay now flights?"
Neutral,Any news? Should I call customer services?
Neutral,I've followed you 
Negative,It's ok. We probs won't use it. Like I say. It costs more to use it and so only then gives us minimal money off. We'll try use in future.
Neutral,You've basically given us a voucher we can never use whether or not we ring CS or use website.
Neutral,Yes we realise that. But the point is. We'll never be able to use it because it's costs us more to book the hotel with the voucher.
Neutral,DM sent
Neutral,"Not sure if I gave correct itinerary. Should be 7260258119900 for Afspanning De Kroon, Booked Klokkenhof last night while outside dead hotel"
Positive,Thank you for your speedy responses much appreciated it's all booked now at only Â£4 more than initially quoted
Positive,Thank you we did that first and there wasn't anything that could be done i just find it difficult to understand the scale of increase
Neutral,I understand fares increase but Â£500 from pressing the button to confirm the holiday to then have a message saying can't complete 
Neutral,@ExpediaUK can u explain why when I tried to complete my booking it wouldn't let me then was told on the phone it had gone up Â£500 in 5mins
Neutral,Left on the streets of Antwerp to find our own solution. With your app.
Negative,Ok. So we can book a hotel on its own? We are struggling to at the moment. It only brings up hotel+flight and not hotel only option 
Neutral,Ok so you didn't answer question. Can we use it on prepaid hotel. We are trying to book hotel.
Neutral,Can we use this voucher for pre-paid hotel? We can't seem to get it to work. We've already booked our main hols this year (through you).
Negative,"@ExpediaUK I like you guys but your marketing is getting aggressive, tone it down and take a chill pill."
Positive,"Thank you for the reply! I like your emails, I don't like the workplace-speak used to grab attention. Social travel should be carefree!"
Negative,@ExpediaUK Brought train tickets at Â£31.05 but it's taken Â£32.05 from my account. Why is there an extra Â£1? No warning about extra charge!
Negative,We did and manager very rude and obstructive.
Negative,@ExpediaUK 26mins on hold and still no help whatsoever!!!very disappointed in the service considering completely Expedia's fault!!
Neutral,"Hi, my itinerary number 114895562792 and my email address is          fieldpfj http://gmail.com ."
Neutral,Can't DM if there's no option to.
Neutral,I've got screenshots of it saying cancelled so I hope that Paragon/Rowton don't charge me.
Negative,@ExpediaUK I have been charged for a car insurance service I did not use. I will like to file a formal complaint.Tried calling several times
Negative,I have the exact same issue
Neutral,@ExpediaUK someone from your call centre has called me about a booking and asked me to call back. None of your numbers seem to be working!
Negative,@ExpediaUK and the absolute biggest failure of a travel agent I have ever experienced. @edenandalou hotel is by far the worst hotel on earth
Neutral,2/2 and the price jumped! Now I've got to search all over again
Neutral,"Thanks I understand that I wasn't knocking you, I just couldn't believe I'd been looking at this all morning and finally decided to book 1/2"
Positive,@ExpediaUK I booked my trip with Expedia and would like to add hold baggage to my easyJet flights. I can't seem to find how online? Help?
Positive,Yeah we'll see how that goes... been passed about on the phone like a joint today 
Neutral,I've been advised to finish my travels and then email the post travel team where an investigation should be carried out apparently 
Negative,I was being sarcastic. The service today has been truly awful.
Neutral,Apps back to not working too and I updated it before.
Neutral,Two hours later and still the same.
Neutral,"You have my money, not Lufthansa."
Neutral,Hi. Still not working.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK the app is super slow at loading and this is the webpage. That is supposed to be the itineraries page
Negative,@ExpediaUK ridiculous! Why say you're going to call today then don't?! Not acceptable to leave people no accommodation for a hol in 3wks
Negative,"@ExpediaUK Error trying to access Itineraries on desktop site, and mobile won't refresh. Known issue?"
Negative,That's fine I have contacted ABTA and have made my claim as you refused to acknowledge your breach under the Sales of Goods and Services Act
Negative,@ExpediaUK please send me the address for your legal team and thanks again for ruining my holiday #civilaction
Positive,@ExpediaUK I am still waiting for someone to contact me as promised several times.  Over 9 months for a refund is completely unacceptable.
Negative,"You're a joke company! You've even sent me another generic message, you really are pathetic."
Positive,"Don't think you appreciate I'm a student I need this money to live off. 3 day ie. Monday Â£500 short with no income, great service that"
Negative,"Hassle is an understatement.I've chased everything,your staff don't care,it shouldn't of happened full stop. You're still doing very little"
Neutral,In fact you took even more doesn't add up. Literally company is a joke.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK re: BA flght cancel frm lst wknd. Service fee chrged to claim??
Neutral,Wsnt told of 3rd party service whn spoke w/expedia rep ystrday
Positive,Uhhh these are 26% butter. #Healthy!  #nosleep #sotired
Negative,#Breakfast time then? Hadn't planned on needing to eat at the #airport! Expensive #cake it is.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK I followed this Twitter page
Neutral,@ExpediaUK I did follow u. So I will not follow u for the 3rd time.  I have no interest to see what ur Twitter page says.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK so there is no need to follow you because once again I hear nothing back.
Negative,@ExpediaUK still haven't heard from anyone regarding my refund I was promised it was a high priority since I had been waiting over 9 months
Positive,@ExpediaUK Still waiting for my refund. Why have you not responded to my emails yet?? Poor service. 
Negative,@ExpediaUK refuse to take any liability and providing insulting compensation! Absolutely shocking  duty of care.
Neutral,Shocking customer service @Expedia. Reservation cancelled without notification leaving three girls stranded in bath at midnight. Answers???!
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Thanks to Rohan for sorting out my complaint - good service from the social media team
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK hi, we're due to fly in a week to Tokyo via Istanbul. Had no confirmations or information about flights etc - can you give us?"
Negative,@ExpediaUK awful service- booked a holiday in Jan and have just been informed that you are in error and there are no rooms available?!
Negative,"I know the issue with Heathrow/BA is big, but please do contact me because i need to confirm my shuttle asap @ExpediaUK"
Positive,"Thanks for the quick response - that's amazing - i will call right now.  Cheers, CM"
Neutral,My wife has been in touch.
Neutral,Email now sent to travel@support.expedia.co.uk as lady on phone can't find any booking (but you've taken my money).
Neutral,I appreciate that @bankofireland caused the issue by semi-rejecting my first attempt to book this holiday. They now say they can't help.
Positive,"Either confirm the booking in full including flights, and refund the second charge, or refund me all charges and confirm cancellation please"
Positive,@ExpediaUK does your price match guarantee include your website - as your prices go up & down daily?
Neutral,Just sent through the details to Phillip Pentland too
Positive,But we tried that before and it did not work! I would engage with any team who could help but everyone you direct me to seems unwilling
Neutral,Thanks
Positive,@ExpediaUK why is your site not taking payments when you click 'buy now'!! Frustrating when u see a deal u want to book!! Tried 4 cards now
Neutral,@ExpediaUK you say C/R will get in touch but they never do when I ring them I'm told you need more time-9 months now how long do you need?!
Negative,Flights as then you would make even more money. Nothing but a scam and ill take this further you scammers
Neutral,Again this is your policy not @British_Airways  I expected more from you especially as i was jyst going to book again.i wont cancel my...
Positive,@ExpediaUK I booked a hotel in Rome through you and paid a lot extra for a colosseum view room and this is what I got... Not worth the money
Neutral,Yes your discriminatary policy http://yes.How  does it feel to be part of a money grabbing agancy?
Neutral,I still haven't heard anything regarding my refund. For anyone thinking of booking with Expedia. I have been waiting 9 months now.
Negative,"Hi. Yes I came via Topcashback directly but they say Expedia has refused it as ""they cannot tell I came via them"" but its obvious"
Negative,"@ExpediaUK fantastic response from Expedia, now being accused of lying in my complaint"
Positive,@ExpediaUK Big shout out to ROHAN for his phenomenal customer service & assistance! So impressed by him - thank you 5 service !!!!

Neutral,"@ExpediaUK Hi, I've booked flights via you with BA, the flights were yesterday, and got cancelled obviously. No any help from BA, can 1/2"
Neutral,Yes its with cust serv and has been for over 6 months-they keep lying to me and promising refunds which never happen. What will be different
Negative,I have done this and want my refund processing as it has been 9 months now. I get a different excuse every time I ring. Very Frustrating!

Neutral,@ExpediaUK still waiting for answers!

Neutral,#britishairways situation today? Been on the call line for over an hr :(
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK Hi, when looking at trips I'm only seeing the option to choose a single location. Is a multi-base holiday possible?"
Neutral,How will they give the points? It is the expedia website that doesn't accept the number in the first place?
Positive,@ExpediaUK promises 1000 Nectar point but does not accept nectar card number!
Negative,I am stuck in Gatwick airport ! No response on that number! It does not even connect / ring - can someone call me?!

Neutral,"@ExpediaUK Since buying rail tickets via you, I lost+replaced debit card. How can I collect tickets? Tried calling but no options worked."
Positive,If you could maybe phone @AskNationwide and tell them all about your secure platform Iâ??m sure theyâ??d be super interested.
Positive,"Iâ??m not saying theyâ??re insecure. Iâ??m saying they look fraudulent to my card provider, because you authorize/charge different amounts."
Neutral,"Yes, thatâ??s what I said. Your transactions look fraudulent, so theyâ??re rejected. Bill me properly next time (if there is one)."
Neutral,@ExpediaUK can someone help me?? Still sitting on hold
Neutral,@ExpediaUK just spoken to someone who has put me on hold for 10 mins ... Still have all original emails trying to book a hotel

Neutral,You have all that info - don't want to put it on here. Itinerary #7245016124325 regarding hire car charges.

Positive,"To be clear, it's not a feeling, it's a fact."
Negative,@ExpediaUK   Look at your customer's concerns which still needs to be done for ref. Mr D Kalyan
Positive,Thanks but I tried several times with the same outcome. Fine if price changes but that should be reflected next time I try.

Positive,"@ExpediaUK customers, please beware of filtered reviews on their site. I would recommend booking via a more ethical site. #digraceful!"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK my hotel has requested I cancel my reservation but my itenary page will not allow me to. What do I do?
Neutral,@ExpediaUK I have been trying to get hold of your customer support line to discuss an issue and I am on hold for 45 min then cut off. ?????
Negative,I understand. It's just a shame that an apology for bad service comes with an expiry date :-(
Neutral,@united  won't do anything with it being a bulk fare? And I haven't checked @lufthansa i just presume its the same?
Neutral,Thanks for the reply. Is there any chance that you could extend this voucher for a couple of months?

Positive,The complaint has been escalated to priority escalations. Thank you for the prompt reply
Neutral,@ExpediaUK you have taken my money no email and customer service useless. Now forced to email Philip Pentland to get a resolution
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK your website seems to be down for me tried to book a holiday numerous times, any reason why?"
Negative,"Great #script - try #customerservice instead...no reason not 2 change refund except money. Dont hide behind T&Cs - come on, admit it! Â£Â£  "
Neutral,Please stop hiding behind & continually reciting the same response. NO reason not to change flight - accept money. You keeping mine! #truth
Neutral,yes have u seen my answer
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK how do, any idea when the prices for Vegas 2018 will be out? Cheers"
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK I am trying to book this tour but you only do a certain number of days in advance, any chance there is space tomorrow (Friday)? "
Neutral,Searched again and they're back where they were - but I'm not signed in this time 
Positive,@ExpediaUK with their gold star customer service again - on hold 30mins and call still not answered #customerservicefail
Neutral,My home no is not the only number on file.  You have my mobile no.  You used it yesterday.  Look again.  It ends 388.
Positive,No you didn't.  I have had no missed calls on my mobile.  Why don't you try again now.  My mobile no is on my account.
Neutral,One minute u say try to reach next u say they will call me.  Do me a favour call me after 4.30pm today without fail pls
Negative,"There's a big difference between 'dealt with' and 'looked into it',ultimately letting their customers down. Absolutely disgusted, @ExpediaUK"
Neutral,"Resolved?! @ExpediaUK retained money paid for subhuman standards lodging, that they're associated with and indeed promoting on their site."
Negative,"This could go on all day. You, representing @ExpediaUK, are totally missing the point, as have #Expedia. A total unjust on their behalf."
Neutral,Hi.  How long is soon?  You told me over 2 hours ago someone would contact me.
Positive,@ExpediaUK can you give me the correct address for 'Courtyard by Marriott New York City Manhattan Midtown East'
Positive,In all due respect you've had 13 weeks... It's fairly simple. You have the email chain and can see the correspondence. #ExposeExpedia
Positive,"@bradwhite4641 We have been told refund request was raised yesterday, not 8th Feb as we were told?!"
Positive,"@bradwhite4641 @BBCWatchdog What we were promised, not delivered."
Neutral,Go away
Neutral,Whats your point?
Neutral,@ExpediaUK booked a holiday with yourself but have notice my name is spelt wrong on eticket and hotel booking how do I correct this?
Positive,"Thanks for the generic response, my point was not that the price had fluctuated, but had tripled. Hard to justify that kind of increase"
Positive,"Sure, you can DM me if you would like"
Negative,@ExpediaUK why do you send fake sale emails. It's very bad marketing and makes me want to do the opposite of what you're expecting from them
Neutral,@ExpediaUK hi im@inyereste dinnbooking Disneyland Paris through your site but was just wondering if both park tickets are included in price?
Neutral,I have DMd you
Negative,@ExpediaUK false advertisement & poor communication. Disgustingly treated and still not rectifying their mistakes!
Neutral,Done
Neutral,I have just added my mobile no to my account.  This was added to my itinerary yesterday and also I put it in my direct message.
Negative,I called the number and they can't advise me about that discount. She said the discount is only available online.
Neutral,Still waiting.  How long does it take to do something very simple.  Please call me now
Neutral,But I used to see a banner telling me that I have a discount because I purchased a flight to that city. Now that banner is gone!
Negative,"@ExpediaUK When booking flights, there is a discount for subsequently booking a hotel? Is there a time limit on this? If so, why a limit?"
Neutral,brilliant answer. We know we have to phone...I told you that.
Neutral,"Read my DM, get my mobile no from the itinerary and call me."
Negative,Who is responsible for putting the wrong name against the e-tickets? Not the airline
Negative,Expedia are still playing games + underhand flight booking methods..  See  first twitter.   Shame on @ExpediaUK & @SingaporeAir.
Negative,"I'm sorry but ""sorry"" doesn't cut it, I must have spent at least 12 hrs over dozen of calls trying 2 fix this. Who's taking responsibility?"
Positive,@ExpediaUK I was assured on Friday my refund would be processed within 24 hours. Still no confirmation. Pls can someone call me to discuss
Negative,In one final act of indignity Expedia managed to mix up our names on the e-tickets. Stephen @flybe worked hard to fix it. AVOID Expedia.
Neutral,Followed
Neutral,@ExpediaUK I took a trip at Easter but my Nectar points not on my account yet. When will they appear? Thx
Neutral,I have just DM'd the itinerary and email address.  I expect a telephone call tomorrow morning.  Please don't make me have to tweet you again
Negative,@ExpediaUK wife been trying to get through phone all day. Do you have problems? Needs to amend a group booking - can't do it online
Negative,"@ExpediaUK im having a problem changing the date of my flight, and the airline says to contact you. But i was put on hold for half an hour"
Neutral,I've been speaking to them for 2 months inc an hours call today. Everyone says they'll sort it and no one ever does.
Neutral,I'm aware. I just want to make all of my friends aware to avoid Expedia at all costs. You can't keep shocking service like this private.
Positive,On the phone to India for over 90 minutes now and still not sorted.  Please can someone in the UK DM me before I lose the will.
Positive,"@ExpediaUK Flights cancelled, no refund and need to book new flights.  Phoned 3 times, holding on for 20-30 mins.  Please DM me asap"

Neutral,"@ExpediaUK hey guys, do you know what Turkish's policy of check in is? I don't think I've put my passport details in anywhere yet and we fly"
Negative,"7232064758463 currently being fobbed off on the phone, callbacks missed. Booking information entered incorrectly by expedia can't check in."

Neutral,@ExpediaUK I've booked some flights but I'm looking to change the date/times slightly. Is this possible?!
Positive,Ok brilliant thanks for your help
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Hi guys were looking at booking flights+hotel+car hire is it possible to book multiple hotels for a booking
Negative,"@ExpediaUK Hi guys, when I completed my booking, it asked me for my nectar number. It didn't work and said I needed to fill out a form?"
Negative,@ExpediaUK Booked flight with BA 6pm Yesterday. 2am I realised the dates were wrong - cancelled. Informed I can't get refund. Can you help?
Neutral,"Totally understand, however this was a 'policy' that the CS rep made up!"
Neutral,I don't believe the cost doubled in the exact 10 mins it took me to book a trip 11 months out. Now tried 3 other packages - same happened???
Negative,@ExpediaUK Tried to book a 5 nt trip to NYC March 2018. Price increased from Â£650 to Â£1166 pp during booking. False advertising. What a con!
Neutral,"I await your findings, thanks"
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK Hey! I want to complete the travellers information but there's no link for SmartWings airlines in your ""Manage My Flight"" page"
Negative,I have tried both numbers and have been disconnected each time. On hold for a total of 15 mins. I have raised a written complaint.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Contacted customer support line 4 times to be disconnected: Mid trip issue to discuss ASAP. Pls advise if someone can contact me
Positive,Yes I am aware - you say .@British_Airways make the T & C and they say I must deal with .@ExpediaUK - piggy in the middle I am #convenient

Neutral,"@ExpediaUK your ""member"" prices are shocking..in comparison with @bookingcom ..same place..major price hike..expedia membership is a con!"
Neutral,Cannot DM you. Probably because you do not follow me
Neutral,I spoke on the phone with colleagues of yours. 2 on Sunday whilst the trans where pending and 1 today after the trans has left my account

Negative,Please forward on my complaint to the relevant dept. I will be writing formally once I am home.
Negative,Too late. I waited over 20min 2 talk 2 someone-no success. I have had 2 book another flight. Shocking customer service in such an emergency!
Negative,@ExpediaUK hi the information on my Expedia + account appears to be wrong please can you help me fix it. Thanks.
Positive,My pleasure 
Neutral,But that's a robot not a human
Positive,@ExpediaUK Please can you help this family with their last holiday? Anything will be greatly appreciated

Positive,@ExpediaUK hi there. When will you have flights available to book from end of Mar-18 into mid Apr-18? Thanks 
Neutral,"I have been waiting since 10.30 last night for the website to work. I want to search for holidays, not book. I will wait a little longer."
Negative,"Ive called the number that you provided and ive also done what they advised to to do over the phone, site still not working! Not happy "
Neutral,Well this is what happens when I try to access your website....
Neutral,@ExpediaUK the website has been down for hours now ? When will it be up and running?
Positive,@ExpediaUK I am trying to book a hotel/flight deal. I am promised flights included in rate but when I choose flights all require more money.
Positive,"@ExpediaUK you promised 200 free miles per day, email booking says 200 in total, your staff refusing to clarify over the phone - why??"
Neutral,Also a penchant for violence there; you might get your head kicked in but at least they'll phone you an ambulance 
Positive,"Back at it again with Â£0 savings, literally so many packages are like this"
Neutral,awaiting your update thanks
Neutral,just done so
Neutral,thanks
Positive,@ExpediaUK would like to thank Shruti for dealing with and sorting out my booking issue! Great customer service  thanks again!

Negative,"@ExpediaUK I received my (latest) 'members only' email with deals, but sadly the only hotels in Prague are at the airport "
Negative,Thanks for confirming the policies aren't created in the customer's interest at all. Good to know.
Neutral,Don't think we're getting anywhere... I said I understand there are policies. Just who's best interest in they're in is debatable.
Neutral,It still doesn't mean you're being customer centric. Who is the policy supposed to support/protect? What's its purpose?
Neutral,Thanks - travelling now but will reply on arrival
Neutral,This would be a dream come true!!!! #SilkRoadRace
Positive,@ExpediaUK would love to visit @Hangzhou_CHINA with @Builtough

Neutral,@ExpediaUK @Hangzhou_CHINA #SilkRoadRace 
Negative,@ExpediaUK nightmare service from Expedia - still unresolved. Really amazed how bad its been.
Neutral,And you can check that I bought and paid for my hotel minutes after this time. I never clicked off your site or through anywhere else! 
Neutral,I did. @Top_CashBack told me that you refused as you couldn't see they were last referral logged. Crazy as they had my referral logged...
Neutral,Thanks 
Neutral,@ExpediaUK how do I go about upgrading seats on a flight booked through you?
Negative,@ExpediaUK Sorry did you get this message?
Negative,Does this mean in effect to a buisness it is 20% more expensive to book with yourselves? #noVAT
Neutral,@ExpediaUK can you please advise how I obtain a VAT invoice for a recent buisness trip
Neutral,I've been speaking to @Top_CashBack for over 18 months & all they will say is they are speaking to Expedia
Negative,Yes but problems with your system meant they had to go directly through hotel which cost more.
Neutral,Was a hotel booking. Change sorted but ended up costing more. Was offered a Â£25 voucher for the hassle. Don't think I'll use Expedia again
Positive,@ExpediaUK the views from your offices are incredible! Great event by @TraverseEvents #traverse17

Neutral,@ExpediaUK I've printed my itinerary and will check in online tomorrow. Anything else I need to do for my trip? (1/2)
Neutral,Done
Positive,@ExpediaUK holiday booking at this time of night is an epic weekend event! I'm not even drunk  Sunshine come at me  #Alicante #July 
Neutral,This really would be a dream come true  #SilkRoadRace!
Negative,"Copy and paste firm, hope you go bankrupt."
Neutral,Fuck off with your AIDS automated responses. Amateurs.
Negative,"No, you message me on here. Shocking system."
Neutral,It doesn't actually mention airport transfers on the guarantee. And it was actually the hotel and flight price that was increased
Positive,If you are booking a holiday you expect a price guarantee for holiday. The transfer price makes no difference to either price.
Negative,I couldn't do it for some reason a lady called Debalina did it for me last night. I had to email copy cheaper quote I found on your website
Negative,@ExpediaUK I'm a US resident who wants a buy a ticket for a UK resident. Will this present any problems? Worried airlines might ask for card
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK if one of your hotels tells you they are closed, pls let your clients know before they turn up in another country to find out!!!!"
Negative,"I already tried calling you, that's the problem, I live in Jordan, The Middle East, and I couldn't call any of the numbers on your website"
Negative,"@ExpediaUK Hello, I'm having trouble reaching you over the phone, and I want to cancel my flight, can you help me with that?"
Neutral,Just noticed you paid 85 pounds back on to my card as comp for the last armpit I stayed in. Agreed amount was 100. Sort this now.
Negative,It doesn't do your reputation much good when you partner up with cowboy operations like these & then refuse responsibility when it goes bad.
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK Hi, I have made a booking for USA with you that includes hire car. What level of insurance cover is offered with this deal?"
Neutral,You're trying to weasel out of your responsibility & it doesn't look good. Contact hotel & find out whether I will be charged.
Positive,"#SilkRoadRace This would be an experience of a lifetime. I would be absolutely thrilled to win, but then, who wouldn't be? "
Negative,As stated they are unable help
Positive,"Ahhhh, exciting! #SilkRoadRace"
Neutral,3 hours of arguing on the phone and Queing in different offices and eventually a manager helped. Not what we booked but at least on road
Neutral,"So arrived in Atlanta no car, nobody could help. Avis wanted $3000 more dollars to provide smaller car. They couldn't contact you either"
Positive,#SilkRoadRace beautiful!
Neutral,Sure - Can you follow me back so I can DM you?
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK Hey, who can I speak to about billing? I've made one booking but you've but 7 holds on my credit card?"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK the bundle deals section of your app hasn't been working for days. What's going on?
Negative,I have DM'ed you. Looping in @dkhos so the CEO of Expedia is aware of the customer service I experienced. Keeping my money is unacceptable.
Neutral,You're not sorry. You'd rather keep over Â£1000 of my money. Not even goodwill gesture was given. Or any credit. Greed over customer service!
Negative,@ExpediaUK really unhappy with the service. Death in the family so we couldn't fly out. Expedia won't refund the flight tickets. Disgusting!
Positive,Would love to visit with @Builtough  #SilkRoadRace
Negative,@ExpediaUK you have completely failed us with car hire today and general #usless behaviour
Positive,"incredible trip, have always wanted to visit China, would be a great adventure! #SilkRoadRace"
Positive,"#SilkRoadRace  love to win a trip to China, rt'd and flwd"
Neutral,Are we nearly there yet?

Neutral,Hi guys! Just checking out your profile & saw this St Patricks Day tweet is still pinned to your profile - might want to pop a new one up?
Positive,"I'd love to, but think you need to follow me to allow for DM. Twitter won't allow me to DM the address you are tweeting from"
Negative,"@ExpediaUK livid! Flights booked didn't  incl luggage. NO indication when booked! Â£240 extra, on top of Â£500 flights"
Neutral,#silkroadrace me and @icecreamsoda88 would LOVEEEEE to visit HangZhou!!  RTed & following! Xx
Neutral,#SilkRoadRace Thanks for the chance 
Neutral,#SilkRoadRace 
Negative,"Pls send my feedback for redesign consideration. I bet tonnes had same issue as me,but never tweeted/said anything.Just moved elsewhere"
Neutral,"...will sort the airport itself, airport not important. Country is."
Neutral,"Hi, I want to travel to Cuba. Cuba has many airports. I'm not interested in airports but all-inclusive holidays to Cuba and the package"
Neutral,#green
Neutral,@ExpediaUK hi.. Is your website working? It will not let me book flights!
Neutral,#SilkRoadRace
Neutral,u r not listening to your customers - I paid Â£75 for a car plus another Â£1200 depst for a VW UP fgs
Neutral,"yr R&R's did not prepare me 4 such a huge deposit - it is unclear, unfair & unethical 2 hide behind 'equal to or larger than'"
Positive,- the huge deposit = no spending money for the holiday - I have had to transfer money 2 pay 4 my kids fun!
Negative,@ExpediaUK - absolute joke customer service. 2 hours yday and 40 min today. Plane from Vegas cancelled only affecting 1 of 8 passengers???
Neutral,@ExpediaUK - your service is an absolute joke. On the phone for 2 hours yesterday and 20 mins today! No closer to a resolution! Grrrr
Positive,"@ExpediaUK Holiday Inn Express Royal Docklands 22 October - Â£120 difference in rate for the addition of ""free"" parking?"
Negative,"@ExpediaUK just called the contact centre and they're useless, even the manager, especially as I'm trying to spend more money with you!"
Neutral,"I'm delighted to hear that. It's such a shame when someone is doing something so lovely and kind, and it all goes wrong!"
Neutral,Can't seem to DM you currently...
Positive,@ExpediaUK my patience is being seriously tested here. Still nowhere to stay this weekend after you cancelled our booking....RSVP ASAP
Negative,"I don't believe your helpless. If Expedia wanted to refund me, Expedia would. "
Neutral,"Expedia, are theiving Â£412.00 from me. How would you feel?"
Positive,"Imagine the foods, the cultures, the beautiful scenery #DreamComeTrue #China #SilkRoadRace   "
Positive,Sounds perfect right about now  #SilkRoadRace
Positive,@Builtough how amazing would this be? #silkroadrace
Positive,This sounds like a great adventure!!  #silkroadrace
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK OK, you won't mind if I go to the British Press?"
Negative,I am afraid your R&R's are not worth the paper they are written on - I have hir d a VW UP NOT a Ferrari & paying a Â£1200 deposit is a joke
Negative,You can if you wanted to. This is just bad customer service and robbery.
Negative,Your rules & regulations are a disgrace! I have rented 100's of cars & never had 2 find Â£1200 deposit!!
Neutral,Loving this race!! #SilkRoadRace
Negative,"@ExpediaUK im confused, how do I search for multi destination hols or do I need to do each bit separately?"
Neutral,So basically @ExpediaUK & @VirginAtlantic are robbing me of Â£412.00?
Negative,@ExpediaUK angry! Two payments 4 a package w/end break taken. No reply 2 a complaint & little help from customer service & No Â£ in my bank!
Neutral,My parents and I still keeping our fingers crossed!  #SilkRoadRace
Neutral,@ExpediaUK here's what I got from the hotel. Spent 30 min on the phone with customer service and got $25 voucher.
Positive,Wonder if there's Monday traffic on the #SilkRoadRace 
Negative,@ExpediaUK Still waiting for 2 refunds from Dec & Mar. How many system errors can there be?#Complaint escalation on way.#badcustomerservice
Positive,Least you got your refund...I'm still waiting over 2 weeks later.
Negative,hi- I can't dm you yet as you are not following me on twitter. Will forward these details when I am able. Thanks for fast reply!
Positive,@ExpediaUK I have a query regarding a refund issued being the wrong amount. How can I rectify this?
Negative,@ExpediaUK Give me an email address and I will send you photographic evidence of the broken air-con. Absolutely abysmal health & safety.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Don't try and duck out of this by saying it's all down to the hotel. IT IS YOU I PAID TO ARRANGE THIS SO YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.
Negative,@ExpediaUK That's 6 sleepless nights for 200 Euros - you should be ashamed of yourselves. I expect alternative accommodation sorted by 9am.
Positive,I would love to visit China! #SilkRoadRace
Negative,Why would you bother? If Expedia have anything to do with it you'll probably end up in some godforsaken hellhole for accommodation.
Neutral,You clearly have a brain-dead gnat's understanding of customer service if you think refusing to answer customers' questions is acceptable.
Neutral,"Thank you,  I have messaged you."
Negative,As a company you should do more research to stop your customers being ripped off. As I said due to this I will never trust Expedia again!
Neutral,"As I said I will never trust your company again, I know that doesn't bother you but that's the truth. I don't like being ripped off!!"
Neutral,That's the trouble you are not bothered at all!
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK I've just been on the phone and updated some flights, but when will the updates show in my itinerary online please? Thanks x"
Negative,"@ExpediaUK Queue for Budget car hire desk @ Dublin for 20 mins as per booking, then told we have to go to off-airport collection. Very poor."
Neutral,Followed. I wait for your DM...
Negative,"Have tried and yr complaints email won't respond. My point is more, how do you expect to get a proper survey response w/o right q's?"
Negative,"@ExpediaUK thx 4unsub survey. You forgot (D) ""because our customer service is crappy"" and (E) ""because I never asked for marketing emails"""
Negative,"@ExpediaUK can you fix this because it's really quite awful for the site to error, not book anything and take money. Will go elsewhere."
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK hi, your website errored during booking, hasnt booked flights and now I have ten or so pending transactions for various things..."
Positive,@ExpediaUK whoever writes your email marketing subjects should calm down with the faux 'Confirmations' and extra S P A C E S.
Neutral,#SilkRoadRace Yes please!! I'd take either Mum or Dad who both do so much for me! We all need an adventure!
Positive,Would love to visit @Hangzhou_CHINA with @builtough #SilkRoadRace
Positive,@ExpediaUK what a turnaround! Sorted out my name change. You've proven that you care and have leverage with airlines! +1 loyal customer! TX!

Positive,Yes spoken on the phone (02030248211) 3 times on Monday and once today. Still no meaningful update as to what's going on
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK had a booking for flights and a hotel in NYC got email from hotel saying shutting booked at Expediauk, cant call number as In USA"
Neutral,"no, but i can tweet you mrs pepper's home phone number if you want?"

Negative,hallo! your customer services managed to mistake me for another customer today. gave me her name and tel no ...
Neutral,done :D

Neutral,WICKED!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK service and rewards customers for loyalty. But don't want to go over Â£250 or stay -3*, can you help?"
Negative,@ExpediaUK now been put on silent hold by Tanushree in the hope I'll hang up after my account was hacked #badservice #CallCentre #fraud
Negative,I am still expecting the phone call your company promised me. Tanushree's lie of not being able to get through is not a good enough excuse
Negative,Tanushree has emailed claiming she tried to call me however this is a lie. No missed calls. Tell her the phone call is 40 mins late now
Positive,"#SilkRoadRace Wow amazing prize, whoever wins will be so lucky xx @SueSuebond"
Positive,How amazing! #SilkRoadRace

Neutral,OK I was unaware that @ebookers was ran by you guys
Positive,#SilkRoadRace love it thanks
Positive,"Happy to do that, you weren't before, so this is progress. Thanks"
Positive,I think this might actually be a trading standards issue. You can't mislead people with prices that don't add up.
Positive,I want to know who controls the calculations on your website and I would like them to answer my question. But they won't be able to.
Neutral,#SilkRoadRace - got everything crossed to go with @icecreamsoda88 RTed & following!! Xx

Neutral,@ExpediaUK On hold for 35 mins about the extra Â£128.61 you decided to charge me without explanation.  unacceptable.  #answeryourphone
Negative,"@ExpediaUK - called you yesterday to sort out a trip I have booked,flights have been changed, useless cs then cut the phone call. No nearer!"
Neutral,You have been inboxing me. Please check to avoid duplication
Positive,OMG this is a chance of a lifetime!  the thought of China makes me super excited #SilkRoadRace
Positive,@ExpediaUK false advertising hotels that say pay at the hotel then they take Â£600. says free cancellation so I cancelled and now no refund!
Positive,@ExpediaUK most useless customer service ever! No notes ever records so it's like having to start again each time! I just want my refund!!!

Neutral,I gave you 3+ wks already! Please say how much more is needed?
Neutral,how do you define 'soon' or 'as soon as possible'? Are your enquiries to the airline time bound?
Neutral,"and how long should I wait? Travel in T-8 days. What if the airline says no to you, again, 3rd time? Same action = Same results."

Neutral,always alwaaaaays wanted to go to china  #silkroadrace
Positive,they never even offered a discount or anything for the horrendous service. I still don't fully know how it was so messed up!
Positive,can you please provide me with an email address to send my details through. I've never had such stress in booking our holiday!
Neutral,plain and and simple case of  charging double for a single service.
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK just dm'd your other twitter a/c.Booked a villa in Antigua thro you yest, for Mon. Yr local agent says not avail??Why no contact?"
Neutral,"appreciate things change whilst online - u'd expect the new rates quoted 2 reflect on new search - really, genuinely appalled."
Neutral,"yes, apparently you haven't been able to redeem for 1 week+; you have to spend 1st and then get a refund? Hence question. @nectar"
Negative,"@ExpediaUK ignore the complaints, hope they give up and go away seems to be the policy even by members of the senior board"
Positive,well in that case it's an empty gesture which really isn't worth any money what so ever and implies arrogantly that I will book -
Negative,@ExpediaUK Why on earth do you think I would give a crap how many ppl have booked in the last hour!!!! Stop IT!!!! so annoying!!!!
Neutral,@ExpediaUK I respectfully ask for a point of contact to file a complaint about social media escalations team.. as wish to take this higher
Negative,"I have already unsubscribed, multiple times, yet i am still getting spam from you, that's the issue!"
Negative,@ExpediaUK i believe this a problem you need to deal with #youmessedup #hotel @jacob1smith
Positive,"@ExpediaUK I've unsubscribed at least 10 times, you have promised to remove me from your  LIST and I am still getting daily email spam"
Negative,"It's been over a week now, I've incurred bank charges, have had accounts frozen & this is taking the piss. Please help!"
Positive,say it's out of their hands & @easyJet needs to refund me. Easyjet says it was booked through Expedia and they need to refund me.
Positive,"In addition, they have authorised a payment to easyjet which has gone out of my account which neither company will refund me!"
Positive,@ExpediaUK #impressed with package deals ...hope you notice. TPx
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK what is your privacy policy? I keep asking to be unsubscribed from the non-stop spam you send, yet everyday I get more emails!"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK and @CorinthiaHotels have absolutely delivered on check in tonight  Simple things make lasting impressions 
Neutral,thanks. DM sent.
Negative,@ExpediaUK What do I have to do to unsubscribe from emails? Do you just ignore unsubscribe requests?
Negative,@ExpediaUK Please tell me how I can apply for a refund for the hotel I'm currently staying in. It's terrible and not worth the Â£264 I paid!
Neutral,"Amazing!  After a very frustrating 6 months, the wonderful Luke has resolved this issue in a five minute phone call. #happy"
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK hey, do you've a contact email for your PR/ marketing for ireland/UK?"
Neutral,....which you arent
Neutral,"already aware of this (see previous msgs), query was whether you are able to book hotels when using multidest flight booking"
Neutral,"the site isn't giving the option to do so on multi-dest flights, only on normal return flights."
Neutral,@ExpediaUK please follow back so I can DM with price match request
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK hello I booked a holiday but didn't put in my Â£50 off code, anyway I can get this at all? "
Neutral,"Thank you for your ""help"" I have taken my custom elsewhere & consulted consumer journo buddies, gotta be a story there somewhere"
Negative,so you don't actually support payments from @AmericanExpress ?
Negative,@ExpediaUK who can I message or talk to for a complaint. Your overseas staff are completely useless! Wasted hours on the phone!!!
Positive,"@ExpediaUK Rohan, I would like to thank you for your excellent support."
Negative,I have filled it out for a stand alone hotel booking. I just worry in case by the time you get around to looking it will be gone
Positive,@ExpediaUK sent in best price guarantee how long do you take answer booked with you and now it's cheaper by significant amount on expedia
Negative,@ExpediaUK is really doing my head in this afternoon with lack of communication over my booking 
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Made a hotel booking via Expedia that I later changed. Credit card statement shows I've been charged twice not once. Please help.
Positive,@ExpediaUK much chance to express himself + is spoken of by others.I'd love to discuss more.Do you have email for corporate responsibility?

Positive,happy to wait and hope for a positive outcome.
Negative,"@ExpediaUK Hi, booked tickets last night for flight and I have my wife's name wrong - contact you or easyjet? Thanks :)"
Negative,"@ExpediaUK how can we contact uk customer services when overseas? Any live chat, or just slow email and Â£ for phone calls?"

Neutral,@ExpediaUK  any chance you all can help?
Positive,thank you very much. Hope you can help and authorise refund or at least give my friend option to rebook within 12 months FOC.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK how long normally take to reply to customer? Last email was weeks ago I have chased up but #stillnotresolved
Neutral,well I just called them and they said because I have checked in online there is nothing that they can do ..
Neutral,well I have flight after 3 hours and I want to change it asap can u give me a call
Negative,your  Ref 7239306268214 we have sent all details of mess up and nothing no happy at all
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK hello ,, I booked through your website and I want you to call me asap coz I'm outside U.K. call me on this please  +12026001116"
Negative,"@ExpediaUK Hi. When a car hire price includes ""zero excess collision coverage"", I'm concerned there's no further info. What does it mean? Tx"
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK thanks remembering that a year ago I booked a hotel for @Hullzapoppin, I'm going again & fancied a change but not to Hull MA!"
Negative,@ExpediaUK How can I change my payment details on a booking? The card hasn't worked and need to update it for the hotel's pre auth checks.
Neutral,what is the meaning of DM
Negative,sorry I have bad response
Positive,@ExpediaUK - what is the best email address to send an email regarding sponsorship please? Many thanks xxx
Neutral,They told me Expedia was their supplier for this booking?
Neutral,"and they couldn't change because of your ""Cancellation policy"""
Positive,@ExpediaUK who should I call to sort out a booking made through @British_Airways who have told me you are their supplier? So far no luck!
Positive,@ExpediaUK (2) seats on our flight. We've to do this 1 month prior to flying (to guarantee seats together). Do we do this through EasyJet?
Neutral,@ExpediaUK (1) we've booked through yourselves for our trip next month to Glasgow flying with EasyJet. How to we 'check in' to confirm our .
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Q. How do you avoid diluting your culture as you grow? A. Embrace all cultures. Let them all exist. #gdroadshow @GlassdoorUK
Positive,i can't make the reservation again due to the link being unavailable and not remembering the hotel name :(
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK I was looking at a trip to Rome yesterday and saved the link in my notes and now its expiered, can you help?"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK your train ticket options are a bit bare.
Positive,"been out a few hours, returned & seems to be all booked... happy days :)"
Neutral,thanks but the landing page said I'd unsubscribed and asked a survey question as to why
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK hit the ""stop these alerts"" button because I don't need price updates for a flight I have since booked. Seemed to unsubscribe me?"
Neutral,But these factors only seem to make your prices go up - they were lower on the direct websites AT THE SAME TIME!
Negative,"Doesn't answer my question... Bottom line is, you charge double & your reasons why don't add up, just like your prices!"
Neutral,If it's a live system with fluctuating prices then why didn't it match my results? It was all done at the same time!
Negative,"@ExpediaUK payment page didnt work wn booking, tried again now it says i have used code cannot be used again, price with code below,"
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK You claim this is ""transactional email."" It isn't. You claim it's based on ""a recent booking"". Only booking I made was September."
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Am I going to receive a statement every month as part of Expedia+? If so I'm going to cancel as appears I can't stop the emails.

Neutral,@ExpediaUK if I book flight & hotel is it ABTA protected? Thanks.
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK I've been getting this on your website for the last two days. If rates have changed, why am I still being offered the old ones?"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK I'd like to add a transfer onto my trip but your website won't allow me to & your customer service dept seem to be incompetent?

Negative,"@ExpediaUK 10 days to get a response on a fraud claim, this is not cool"
Negative,@ExpediaUK I have just received possibly the worst customer service ever after they booked the wrong flights for my family holiday.
Neutral,it's telling me no flights for the dates I want but if I do it separately it's fine but obviously more expensive.
Negative,@ExpediaUK are you having any tech issues on the website? Trying to book hotel and flight and it tells me ... http://tmi.me/1fhvJw

Positive,like I've said it needs to be a call between 6pm and 7pm. I am in work 8-6. They or their superior will need to call tonight.
Negative,"the number provided doesn't seem to go through to customer services, which of the options would be appropriate for complaints?"
Neutral,"I haven't, I find phone calls difficult (anxiety) is there not an email address I can use?"
Positive,@ExpediaUK have promised the refund from 16 Oct 2016 3 times so far. The airline says it takes 3 days to refund into my account.

Negative,@ExpediaUK Having troubles with your website please can you help?
Neutral,@ExpediaUK promised me a CB today before 8pm to tell me how my account was hacked and how a fraudulent booking was made. No CB. No reason.
Positive,so why didn't they call me between 6 and 7pm today? Why did no one contact me to advise they couldn't be bothered to phone me?
Neutral,I told you yesterday I was able to get a call between 6 and 8pm. Surely the team can count and know 6 is before 7pm? 1/2
Positive,@ExpediaUK   Hello! Is there a customer support email address I can use? I can only find a phone number on your website. Thanks!
Positive,@ExpediaUK Hi. Thanks to you travel support team for the quick reply and info on price match excellent service!

Neutral,"I know, am tagging quidco for their response as am constantly told it's you guys holding it up... going round in circles :("
Neutral,"the email came through OK but its for the canceled flight, the one I was told had been cancelled."
Neutral,I just thought your marketing team might want to know why a longtime customer is now going to be using ebookers.
Negative,I know that is why I said affiliate window. Your advertising team need to know they're losing sales due 2 bad affiliate networks.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Any explaination for the large amounts of declined cashback payments and complaints for Expedia on TCB who use Affiliate Window?
Positive,"Expedia don't tell you the class b4 u book, only after. Was exactly same price 2 book direct with airline, not a cheap fare...."
Positive,"I understand that but if Expedia had booked into any other class than the lowest, I could have upgraded using miles with no fees!"
Negative,"@ExpediaUK BEWARE!! Expedia book flights in lowest fare classes, they can't be changed or upgraded without huge fees - Lesson learned! :-("
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK hello, Iâ??m planning to change a return flight and reroute to another location on the flight back, whatâ??s the process?"
Negative,beautiful.  I remember niagara falls freezing over.  Stunning to see on picture.
Neutral,ok thanks. I'm calling them but been on hold for a while.
Neutral,"That's it, that's all that's happened. I'm hoping he will escalate it."
Positive,I'd like to look at Dubai deals but it's saying no flights available when I search on desktop & server error on mobile app!
Positive,"He's seen sense & changed my flight, but I'm still over Â£200 out of pocket & have no faith in Expedia for my holiday"
Neutral,make me pay again. It's really destroyed my faith in the company & I am worried about my holiday booked with you.
Negative,"hi, I have tried to DM but getting a message that I am unable to privately message the account."
Neutral,why on earth would they promise that then? Bizarre! Just say you have no intention of calling me on the weekend and will call Mon
Neutral,ok. I was meant to be getting a call back today at the latest. If I don't hear back by 8 can I contact you again? Getting fed up
Negative,@ExpediaUK still no response to email sent over a week ago. Due to your error car hire prices now Â£50+ more expensive.
Positive,can't talk on phone from 8am to 6pm. When will I get a phone call?? Will I actually get a phone or is this another empty promise?
Negative,I've asked over email how to make complaint and no response. I cannot call again now as in South America
Negative,can I have email address I can forward complaint to as I have got 5 emails I need to attach.
Neutral,how do I make formal complaints to you because I have never received such a bad service! For such a big company is appalling
Neutral,yes get @British_Airways to stop blaming affiliates for hidden baggage charges when they take the bulk of the booking fee.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Do follow me back when you get a moment please
Neutral,@ExpediaUK I have unsubscribed from all emails SIX TIMES! STOP EMAILING ME ALREADY 
Neutral,"please can you follow me so that I can DM details, thanks"

Negative,@ExpediaUK problem with itinerary: 7236324143556 saying breakfast not included when my confirmation states is. Please contact hotel urgently
Negative,"@ExpediaUK are useless, do not book through them!!!!"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK why did you charge me in full for hotel booking despite your website saying I was to be charged @ hotel?! #badservice 
Positive,@ExpediaUK HEY HOW DO I CONTACT YOU YOU NEED TO GIVE ME A REFUND
Neutral,Come on maaaaan! I'm waiting to book 
Negative,@ExpediaUK do you get a kick out of ruining a #honeymoon 200 points go straight to the bank!
Neutral,Not yet - I've had money for flights taken but not the hotel. Ill contact them now

Neutral,"@ExpediaUK hi, hope you can help, my bank have confirmed a transaction has been confirmed to you but I have not received bookng confirmation"
Positive,wow they've gone the extra mile at disney land this year
Negative,refund timeline policy on the website contradicts with whatever I have been told on the phone. Very disappointing!
Negative,Since the 4th of December and the money has not been credited. Every employee assums random days approx until refund is received
Neutral,@ExpediaUK A very inconvenience treatement in the refund department. Wasted all my credit just to find out when the refund is due.
Negative,I've already been on the phone to be told I have a non refundable ticket so I loose the majority of my money ! Or if I change
Neutral,@ExpediaUK I will no longer use your site! I will book directly with the airline! #moneygrabbing #crapcustomerservice
Negative,@ExpediaUK booked what I thought was an all inclusive holiday ticking relevant box. Turns out I've just got a room. False advertising!
Neutral,@ExpediaUK still waiting for a phone call back from Monday evening. Any chance you have a freephone number as I'm not ringing Arizona again!
Negative,"@ExpediaUK hi I'm having a problem with my account and accessing confirmation emails, could you please help me out"
Positive,@ExpediaUK Hello! I was charged for one booking by both you & the airline I booked through your website. How can I contact you for a refund?
Positive,please read again it's not you I have the problem with. I said I should of used you
Neutral,ok think I need you to follow me so I can DM u
Positive,@ExpediaUK booked flights and hotel with you - do I need printed confirmation to checkin? Or does your app suffice? Thanks
Neutral,Great one!
Positive,"@ExpediaUK charged extra â?¬45 on Â£32 @Europcar (Interrent) rental for being 45m late, NOT 1h15m as stated on checkin report! no grace period?"
Positive,"thank you. Good luck @MckKirk, let's get this sorted brother!"

Neutral,@ExpediaUK My mum & dad just noticed they accidentally booked their trip to Vienna for 12th-15th of Jan instead of Feb. Can you help?
Neutral,that's not overly helpful for when we travel. We want to know terminal numbers etc while travelling. Is this a bug in the app?
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Hi Expedia! My husband and I both keep getting this message on the app when trying to see airport details for our trip. Help?
Negative,will you be calling to ask for another 72 hours? Getting pretty fed up with how careless you are treating this security breach
Neutral,SHAME - no response yet. Have 'humanity' if not 'professionalism'! You not just ruined our holiday but endangered 3 life's...
Positive,@ExpediaUK Well done advert re: young photographer going to Iceland!
Positive,"person who phoned me wanted to call me back in THREE days, not tomorrow. Really unimpressed with help after fraud on account."
Negative,Expedia would be liable as it is Expedia who's storing my data unsecurely + allowing fraudulent access despite being notified 2/2
Neutral,"Until then, is there anyway you can block anyone from making changes on my account? If this person is still accessing then 1/2"
Negative,"@ExpediaUK Always reliable, never had problems! Thank you :)"
Negative,why do you think a voucher handcuff from the very company that treated your case with such contempt is palatable compensation?
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK email about Expedia+, I joined, no ,2000 free points. You can't tell me 1000 people joined quicker?"
Positive,"@ExpediaUK Hi, I've been selected for gold status, and the email tells me to login to accept Ts&Cs, but I cannot see where to accept?"
Positive,"I was joking but that sounds great, thank you."
Negative,"@ExpediaUK Until the UK get their Muslim problem under control, especially London, I'll never come back."
Neutral,by restricting any compensation to an @ExpediaUK voucher you think I would want to use @ExpediaUK again after this experience?

Negative,Well damn... Now I'm nervous about my refund. 
Negative,ok thanks. I've booked direct with Ryanair and will book hotel or Airbnb separately. Sorry I couldn't use you this time.
Neutral,thanks but they haven't just gone up a bit. They've trebled! It must be a glitch. I'll book flights and an Airbnb if they stay
Negative,@ExpediaUK hello. Why are your prices for a 6 night Barcelona break in April 3-4 times higher than they were on Friday?
Neutral,can't afford to rebook my flight now..... Not ideal...... 
Neutral,I have DM'd you.
Negative,so that means you agree that it was not investigated correctly or thoroughly on the numerous other occasions I was told it was!!!
Neutral,I'm assuming you can get me a good 'deal' if I have to visit your office to protest in person?
Positive,You have had the money since 13 Nov 2016 and you want another 10-days?  It will be better if you hand yourself in to authorities.
Neutral,Due the unexplained and size of the increase we looked around and booked elsewhere. I would still like this looked into though
Neutral,@ExpediaUK you need to check your website. Tried booking a hotel thru you only to be told the hotel didn't offer reserve/paylater.
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK hi, I had a discount code but my payment was taken before I could enter it. Could I still get the discount?"
Neutral,surely something should be done so this doesn't happen again! This has happened twice now! We book through you so much!
Positive,"thanks for the refund, but that is the least you could do! We didn't take the car!"
Positive,Already did that and it didn't help so only thing I can do now is a chargeback and cancel the trips I have booked with you. Joy!
Positive,"@ExpediaUK Hello! Had my ticket cancelled by the airline and you told me a refund can take 12 weeks? That's not right, is it? It can't be."
Neutral,"sure, could you follow me so I can DM please."
Positive,"perhaps ""baggage not included"" would be clearer?? Before we got walloped an extra Â£200 #ripoff 1/2"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK chasing you for a refund two weeks after the agreed rebate date. Final straw after a poor hotel experience! Wont be booking again
Neutral,thought you may not as Shoabs attitude re some of the rubbish he was talking didn't seem like a man who having his call recorded!

Neutral,"@ExpediaUK shambolic customer service in Banglahor, do you have an alternative number?"

Positive,"Disgrace! Trying to get a promised refund 4months later, constant technical problems on your system, Avoiding repayment?"

Positive,"@ExpediaUK check your app for iPad, I cannot enter a departure airport, oh well over to"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK want to book #accessible hotel in Madrid but can't guarantee thru your site? What happens if room not possible once booked?
Positive,Why did you say during the booking process that I would be awarded 200 @nectar points... then say it was just 21 after I paid.
Neutral,"Ok, so it is a joke.  No reply to my request for help. You web site asks for a mobile number 10 digits long.  ALL UK NO's ARE 11!"
Neutral,"Not sure if that's a joke? The '330' number doesn't work?  I live in the UK - I thought you did too, the clue was in your name..."
Negative,@ExpediaUK @easyJet Hoping you're going to give my suitcase a lift home from Poland? Struggling to see how else it'll happen.

Neutral,"still no call, no update and another email telling me I should be the one to arrange the shuttle service."
Neutral,is it possible to DM you it's quite long?
Neutral,@ExpediaUK I could really use some help please?
Negative,"you apparently didn't seem to be able to help either.. you offered me Â£25. Not worth it for the filth, my asthma and wasted time"

Negative,"So, as a UK traveller buying a UK hotel room, I don't have to pay VAT? (Could this work for groceries, too?)."
Positive,"How do you mean, ""as we're http://expedia.co.uk ""? I'm pretty sure UK firms are supposed to charge VAT on services they supply."
Neutral,a Â£25 discount doesn't suffice for the disgusting condition of the hotel...
Neutral,"I can't DM unless you follow me. In addition, my name is Gwyn, not Gwny!"

Neutral,"Sure thing, can you follow me please so I can DM you. Thanks."
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK I booked a flight with you, how do I find out what my baggage allowance is and whether a meal is included?"
Negative,"Yes, you have. Unfortunately CS never have. and I am looking for other avenues to ensure a resolution and compensation"
Positive,sounds great but I'm really looking for 90+
Neutral,do you need to follow me
Positive,@ExpediaUK I am trying to get a refund on a booking. Been waiting 3 weeks+ for someone to call me back. How do we get this sorted?
Negative,Your staff have done this from the outset and you refuse to answer my queries. This level of customer service is unacceptable.
Negative,Is this some sort of joke?  Why do you keep misaddressing me?
Neutral,Don't send too many people underground.
Positive,I like my privacy.
Neutral,"Sincerely, Mole."
Neutral,hi - DM sent.
Neutral,"hi that was the team I was speaking too.30 min plus call. tried separate browsers on different devices,still can't select voucher"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK hi - pretty annoyed at customer service call centre. There's clearly an issue with nectar voucher not showing but brushed it off!
Negative,"there's only 85, I was very disappointed"
Positive,@ExpediaUK The link doesn't work...
Negative,"the cost of the calls probably outweighs refund due. The Crux is this, you dont honor your best price guarantee with any grace"
Positive,after another call (30min) 'as a good will gesture' Expedia will refund the additional money rightfully owed. Atrocious service
Positive,I'm not unhappy with the fee. You've charged me for not actually changing anything and refuse to refund back.
Negative,#7184028565050 getting embarrassing now. Refusing to pay full amount despite ALL criteria matched amount reduced further.
Positive,@ExpediaUK your best price guarantee is a farce & service has been abysmal. Still not been reimbursed months after hotel stay.
Neutral,"happy to keep this public. Enquire about ticket change, quoted wrong price (Â£600 less) don't go ahead and now charged Â£350."
Neutral,yep been in some of the catacombs and can confirm I never went down a grid
Negative,@ExpediaUK worst company I've ever dealt with. Unethical and unprofessional. Book with Airlines direct
Negative,I have already given your complaints team the chance to do this. They have responded. I am going to the OFT and courts now.
Positive,I already have and they were of no help! Said it was my fault despite you not making it absolutely clear!
Negative,still con artists! Have complained and I think you have changed your website since I complained.
Positive,"I will do, thank you for coming back to me."
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK left an honest hotel review on Expedia, hotel responds to post with factually incorrect info. Anything else one can do?"
Neutral,it's via the @AviosUK app to collect avios points
Positive,do I win a free holiday now?
Neutral,you need to follow me first....
Positive,"@ExpediaUK Hi. Can you explain how rental car insurance, included as standard, works please? @SixtUSA have referred me back to you. Thx."
Neutral,thankyou for sorting 
Positive,I hope so. I don't hold much hope as I have been constantly messed about. Thankyou.
Negative,"@zogg001 Funny how after I attempted a google search, THIS keeps popping up on my Twitter feed as a promotion! #RomeCatacombs"
Neutral,This is not helpful. Someone else disconnected yesterday as soon as I asked a question. Please supply the CEO's e-mail address.
Neutral,Why DM?  Why should it be secret? Why can you not ask Prakash and ask for an explanation for his choice to disconnect.
Neutral,"Dear ""R"", I have reported this on Chat and Twitter.  Please investigate now. I have been ignored twice through ""Disconnect""."
Neutral,I have written to Expedia on Chat and Twitter.  You now need to investigate and write back. Stop passing the buck please.
Neutral,I trust you can ask Prakash for his transcripts from lunchtime as this has only just happened. Such service loses you business.
Neutral,I do not know what you mean. I have no itinerary and had not got that far. Please send a name and e-mail address for complaints.
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK Ur price guarantee. Apparently the T&Cs for the EXACT same package can change daily, therefore not meeting your terms. Not fair."
Neutral,@ExpediaUK need some help regarding possible multiple transactions
Negative,sadly it's a common occurrence! I've just responded to your DM
Neutral,@ExpediaUK another check-in another situation where u didn't advise of elite status. Lost count of how many times this has now happened!
Neutral,no thanks I am claustrophobic
Neutral,thanks
Positive,looks more like a Viet Con tunnel
Neutral,@ExpediaUK
Positive,Andy Murray won it enough said
Neutral,@ExpediaUK we've booked BA flight tickets - do we need to print anything off? Or just check in online the day before?
Neutral,done!
Neutral,have done.
Positive,I will be calling on my return to the UK and will be expecting a full refund plus refund of the taxi fares to the stadium & back
Neutral,@ExpediaUK When you book a Nou Camp stadium tour only to turn up and be told that the stadium tour is closed but we can visit the museum!!!!
Positive,"thank you, I've received it now."
Neutral,@ExpediaUK second time I've booked a hotel with you in a month & not received a confirmation email 
Neutral,@ExpediaUK do you offer any kind of gift vouchers or gift card?
Neutral,"one was an explorer, the other a scruffy detective"
Neutral,"you do it regularly though, pls change your algorithms"
Negative,@ExpediaUK I'm not very impressed I'm having to wait 7-8 weeks for a refund because a member of your staff didn't complete the refund before
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK Hello, I just sent a DM. Are you able to check this out?"
Negative,"None, thanks. I'm good where I am. It just struck me as a silly way to frame an ad for flights."
Neutral,Or you could carry an umbrella and explore the city you're in when it starts to rain. Concealed carry is legal for umbrellas.
Neutral,but that's a photo of vietnams war tunnels
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Your many flight changes are leaving my family and I stranded in Johannesburg. Need this sorted ASAP!!
Neutral,".. except I can't, you'll have to give me a follow or set your twitter account to accept messages from all "

Negative,@ExpediaUK I am sick and tired from Expedia- biggest mistake ever to book holidays with Expedia
Neutral,@ExpediaUK can I give someone Expedia+ points? We are planning to book a hotel together but we want to share the points...
Negative,takes 6 days to reply (very long 72 hours) then doesn't even read the email sent!! Not like this had been ongoing for 3 months 
Neutral,q7 is incorrect. La Paz is the capital of Bolivia.
Negative,And you smell.
Negative,Also you have the WORST hold music. Who puts fiddle players on their hold music? AS. IF.
Negative,Ok - they also seem to not know. Good work all round.
Neutral,done
Neutral,I am now following you. Thanks
Negative,"@ExpediaUK gets on the #staycation train, launching #rail breaks in the UK & beyond. #railholidays #trains"
Neutral,I also went to the Qatar airlines office in Nairobi but they told me to contact you
Neutral,I have been trying to cancel and I sent an email to notifications@expedia.com on 24th November and a reminder this Monday
Negative,@ExpediaUK ...worse still is having someone calling me from a US based 'investigation team' - not an ounce of customer service 
Negative,@ExpediaUK So far this year I've spent Â£20k on hotels with you for my companies. One issue with double booking & you won't resolve....
Positive,Thanks for the prompt reply . Itinerary number is 1141465051649. The passenger cannot travel until February for health  reasons
Positive,thank you. I'll send it over ASAP.
Positive,"I am, packing as fast as I can to get out. I though duvets & heating were the norm in hotels?"
Negative,"@ExpediaUK I rarely say this, but I want my money back. Take the apollo hotel london off your site. Disgrace"
Negative,Not sure my Saga insurance would cover me for any of these.  Shame
Neutral,@ExpediaUK do your online listed hotel prices in London include VAT if booked from the US? Thanks!
Positive,@ExpediaUK The web site is good. The amalgamation of all the flight choices works well. I feel confident that market is well represented

Neutral,nightmare. Now been told we may get more info at 19.30
Negative,We were told we could have Â£5 vouchers so queued up and they had none. Joke outfit!

Positive,Ok. I can't see anywhere to delete or modify a trip?  Don't worry I'll leave it. Thanks
Negative,I seriously doubt that you have no provision for flexibility in such circumstances. More likely you can't be bothered to try
Neutral,... so you can count on my custom being directed elsewhere in future.
Negative,Ok. So how do I delete the itinerary? Split into multiple tweets if need be. I don't want some 3rd party app accessing my account. Cheers

Positive,so I have to call u again? Your company really doesn't care about its customers. Sorry must be your company mantra. #sorryexcuse
Negative,by failing to contact me to resolve this matter you are giving me all the evidence I need to have my bank reverse the bill.

Negative,I wholeheartedly disagree! Inconsiderate of the situation. Faceless robots with zero seniority and compassion. #frontlineminions
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK please thank Rohan for all his help, excellent service and resolved the complicated issue! Thanks to him I'll be using you again"
Neutral,the discrepancy is with what's presented on the booking screen then after you've paid for something the reservation changes.
Negative,really frustrating experience dealing with you -discrepancies in your pricing. Does not inspire confidence at all.V. disappointed
Negative,@ExpediaUK reply to me please . You have stolen my money in return - NO holiday confirmation.
Negative,@ExpediaUK this is urgent. Can you please follow me so I can DM you. Horrendous  service so far
Negative,"@ExpediaUK has the worst call waiting music in the history of mankind, specifically chosen to stop people holding #screechingviolins"
Positive,@expediauk does a free cancellation hotel not mean we pay full price when we get there? Been charged Â£75 by hotel & don't know why pls help?
Negative,@ExpediaUK @Orbitz @CheapOair how many time do I have to unsubscribe from your damn emails??? It's doing my head in
Neutral,thankyou
Neutral,is there an email address or does it have to be by phone
Neutral,is it due to the rates changing
Neutral,how do I know if it is booked
Neutral,"the voice message was left by a ""senior manager"" from Expedia so they can listen to your internal recording"
Neutral,thank you. Can you ask them to listen to the original call (130 mins long) plus the message that was left on my voicemail?
Negative,"I was having the same issue, but now it's just failing every time I try to make a booking."
Negative,"I absolutely despair at your customer service. Just had a ""senior manager"" (no name) leave a message. What number do I call on?"
Neutral,Don't need help - just a working website...
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK All cities worldwide are 95% booked and ""there may be rooms available"" - is this the latest @ExpediaUK joke?"
Negative,@ExpediaUK very poor first impressions of using you. Issue with booking - called your support line & you can't even retrieve it. 
Neutral,your customer service should have known that. My previous airline booking all had receipts too.
Positive,would be interesting to find out why the receipt was not generated when Expedia took the payment. System broke down?
Positive,thank you! Think I've managed to work it out :)
Positive,"@ExpediaUK Hi, just booked a package holiday to Nashville, but when I booked, didn't ask me for passport number etc. Did I book correctly?"
Negative,@ExpediaUK are you aware of tech issues - trying to complete payment but site keeps telling me to wait & try again in a moment... worried
Positive,@ExpediaUK 2of2 had a late arrival with family in tow. told lose room or pay. Not great service. Expect better from you. Itin 7219805245577
Positive,@ExpediaUK I just had to pay for a hotel room twice-once to you and once to the hotel on arrival. Please refund me. Itin 7219805245577 1of2
Negative,@ExpediaUK Absolute disgrace! Trying to book a holiday but soo many issues! Customer services are completely useless blaming @easyJet! Joke!
Negative,"@ExpediaUK oh yeah, ""technical difficulties"" - you mean, let us put the car hire price up Â£19 for you. Reverse that please or lose the sale."
Negative,It was very annoying to ring Brittania Hotels on the number on your email to be told they can't do anything though. Cheers H!
Positive,yes or no? It's not hard your website says sale but this is not shown in prices they have gone up
Positive,@ExpediaUK please can someone contact me regard my booking. Currntly in resort
Neutral,IDK whom to contact. Incase of my flight cancellation i did not get any call and i used twitter to finally get a call. Dont know how it wrks
Negative,"@ExpediaUK hi, I'm having problems with my booking they did overcharge me, can you contact me please ?"
Neutral,i dont accept the price changing after i send my bank details without any notification.
Negative,@ExpediaUK trying to resolve a booking disaster with you guys and still after 3 days it's not resolved. Very upset.
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK I paid Â£120 for a hotel, I asked to change the date to the next day and you want to charge me an extra Â£198.. where's the logic?"
Neutral,Back from holiday. Thanks to Shruti for sorting this out.
Neutral,could you follow me please so I am able to send you a DM? Thanks
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK I booked a hotel + flight 2day & have only received confirmation from the airline, when will I get an email confirming the hotel?"
Neutral,@expediauk complaint raised on 16th promised a response in 5 days no word and out of pocket # badcustomerservice
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Cannot seem to check in online for flight tomorrow. Can you please assist
Negative,@ExpediaUK can you tell me where the voucher that was meant to be on my account is? Still getting bad service.
Neutral,great...can you get a manager to call me as they were supposed to today rather than half message tweets promoting some app!!!
Positive,appreciate 'investigation' may take time but an initial response is minimum coutesy
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK hi, when I sign in it does not show the 10 per cent price adjustment?"
Positive,I have sent a reply to the facebook post. Thank you.
Negative,"@ExpediaUK very disappointed with your service, flight got cancelled said u would email me other options nothing yet, been on phone 3 hours"
Negative,@ExpediaUK . Never again will I deal with such a useless unhelpful company. Complete nightmare. All to change a flight!!
Negative,@ExpediaUK @ExpediaAsia you have shocked me with recent service.Still waiting a response. End of holiday ruined. Gutted.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Email sent to customer services over a week ago and no response. Can you investigate please? Ref 7209034337656. Thanks
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Can you still book flight+hotel+car with just a deposit and pay rest later?
Neutral,@ExpediaUK your 03301231235 phone options are not working and I need to speak to a human being about an existing booking #frustrated
Positive,@ExpediaUK put the phone down on me today after I kindly asked to speak with a manager. #professionalNOT
Negative,ok how can I get a quick turnaround on a complaint?
Positive,"I would much appreciate another review of this case, you cannot book a hotel and turn up to have it be closed!"
Neutral,"I have also emailed them twice since this offer with no reply, hence the reason I am now on a public forum."
Positive,how do i get hold of the sales support? 4 tweets later i still dont know if you charge a fee for using AMEX on your site to book!
Neutral,the phone number is answering but after pressing 1 and then 3 it goes dead. How do I sort my cancellation? Can you call me?
Negative,that's exactly what I've tried a number of times but it just goes dead after that.
Negative,@ExpediaUK trying to get through on the phone to cancel a booking but after going through the automated menu the line just goes dead??
Neutral,that information is only any good if someone answers. After automation it just dies. Shoddy to say the least.
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK hello ive a question on my booking, can u follow me so i can DM you my details? Thanks so much "
Negative,@ExpediaUK picked up a car from @GreenMotion in #Edinburgh airport who informed me #Expedia insurance is useless had to pay Â£120.00 extra?
Negative,I reached out to them and they flatly refused to assist with the cancellation.
Neutral,I need to know if I have anywhere for myself & my 3 young children to stay when I fly in the morning! The hotel is not answering!
Neutral,You guys are not following your policy as stipulated on your website.
Negative,what is going on! Now have hotel texting to ask if I am going ahead with cancellation as per Expedia request. The mess continues!
Positive,"@ExpediaUK Please refund my money. Your ""fine print"" states it's possible to get a refund within 24 Hours of buying my ticket in the U.K."
Positive,it's not my problem - I'm not going to book. It will just be a very expensive mistake for you guys.
Positive,it's fine on your main website but not when entering by searching for package holidays http://www.expedia.co.uk/cv/package-holidays â?¦
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK hi, noticed that your online calendar is a day out when trying to book. Says today is tuesday."
Positive,@ExpediaUK well done for helping resolve my issue. Thank you. Will recommend you. #expedia #customerservice
Negative,"I'm fact tell them that in comparison to your competitions it is dated, clumsy and unreliable. Some investment req. I think."
Negative,but how about you let your web people know that rental searches don't work for the last day it says you can select? That's all.
Neutral,"I've just told you I don't want to call, I want to check prices for various configurations. Seems I'll be able to do it tomorrow"
Negative,@ExpediaUK I followed your complaints procedure & emailed 3 times since 14th Oct! Guess you dont want to deal with my complaint? #ignorance
Positive,itinerary no: 7215982858393. Might get a more satisfactory response if we keep this public. Might get my money back #con #expedia
Negative,yes. They don't know where my money is. They think it's on hold but don't know. Just had to pay twice #scam
Neutral,There is no option to DM you only tweet to you.
Positive,@ExpediaUK just back from Disneyland Paris hotel and flights through Expedia worked amazing family loved trip the Expedia app was great !
Negative,@ExpediaUK Customer service is the worst!  Almost a week and still haven't solved a really simple issue!!
Negative,my itinerary number is 110621103414 I missed you calls
Negative,"please donâ??t put my number on twitter/delete tweet, I have been told by your CS team that the number that has called me is fake"
Negative,not my point I'm concerned about someone scamming me claiming to be from expedia
Positive,@ExpediaUK #expediauk Thanks to the social media team for sorting my overcharge. Brilliant service! 
Neutral,Now it can't even do a simple search...despite the same search working earlier.
Negative,"@ExpediaUK Is there something wrong with bookings for flight, hotel and car? This is frustrating...every time I try to pick a car."
Negative,That's great - and sorry for contacting the US helpers by mistake!
Neutral,Please could you reply asap? I'm flying tomorrow so would really like to resolve this issue before I arrive.
Negative,Can understand the rush due to typhon. But 4 hours of phone calls and still no itinerary recieved. Dissapointed.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Hi i've sent you a DM please could you reply. Thanks
Negative,@ExpediaUK I am trying to cancel a holiday but just get an error when I try to cancel 2nd room. itinerary number 7218569377305
Neutral,"seriously, no msgs or call till now!!! I do not want apologies, just provide me same tickets next day ?"
Positive,"@ExpediaUK any reason I can book a flight or hotel separately but if I do ""flight and hotel"" it says no hotels available?"
Neutral,Think you need to follow me as it won't let me DM you
Neutral,Any idea when exactly they will be in touch? because the booking still stands and the manager never even spoke to me yesterday
Positive,spoke to a member of your staff last night who promised to send me an email about refundâ?¦12hrs later no email
Neutral,"flights still haven't been cancelled, waiting for another call today, just saying 'you're not covered' w/ clause ref. is not OK!"
Negative,"- will this be a problem when checking in, going through passport control, boarding? Names on passports have capital letters"
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK - I recently booked flights via phone, but the names of everyone traveling have been entered in lower case by your staff."
Negative,@ExpediaUK I want 2 make a complaint re booking I made My flights have been changed 4 times which now means I spend 4hrs less with my family
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK booked a hotel with you last week and this week it has dropped in price significantly , but I can't cancel the original"
Positive,"she was told on 1/10 the refund would be 3-5 days. She's just been told the same again today, after over an hour on the phone"
Negative,@ExpediaUK this is a joke... Been trying to book a flight all afternoon... Been on hold for 49 mins... I just want to pay!!!! #hurryup
Negative,"You can reproduce the error by clicking this link http://www.expedia.co.uk/vc/package-holidays/iceland â?¦ - you should report it to your tech team, not my job."
Neutral,"It was fixed in the past 5 mins, happened on multiple PCs. The page I was on has also now been removed: http://www.expedia.co.uk/vc/package-holidays/iceland â?¦"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK can you see this reply from @NatWest_Help. how do I get my money back if you won't even provide proof of trfr ?
Neutral,incoming payments.Please check with the sending bank so that a trace can be placed with them. Thanks NM
Neutral,"also requested via email inc why this has been mishandled & further info I have rights to, please ensure it is responded to!"
Neutral,"I have rights under the DPA to information inc recorded calls and to information about your regulatory body, I await this still!"
Negative,you have confirmed this in relation to your web error but my complaint is now over the handling of this case and needs reviewing!
Neutral,this is not a reasonable offer to compensate for your web error & 7hrs of calls. Email sent now needs attention inc DPA request!
Neutral,"I've tried, but cannot get through. In the internet age this really shouldn't necessitate phonecalls!"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK I'm in Colombia and for family reasons need to change a flight back to UK - how can I contact you online? No email on the website
Neutral,"still no reply, if I call someone with a script will tell me escalation will call in 48hours which they never do! #goingincircles"
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK to top it all off, I've spoken to three useless call centre agents until my mobile credits ran out. @comnio how do I deal with it"
Negative,"@ExpediaUK I've had a terrible experience you where you confirmed my hotel was booked, but when i got there, the hotel didn't know anything"
Positive,u gave me a refund but didn't come to my account and you refuse to do a trace or recall so you can send it again Y ... not on
Positive,No that's okay - I already spent a morning of my time on this. I'm abroad & will expect the refund by tomorrow.
Neutral,"Refund should have taken a max of 72 hrs. You've taken your fee (even tho the flight didn't exist), so wondering where refund is."
Negative,@ExpediaUK the worst customer experience of my lifetime!!!
Neutral,On hold for more than an hour and a half
Neutral,#poorcustomerservice
Neutral,high light of summer would also have to be pool of sprinkles #EndlessSummer
Negative,wish summer didn't and this pic of over looking p the Brooklyn bridge proves it #EndlessSummer
Positive,please take me back to this sunset in Panama my favorite memory thus far #EndlessSummer
Negative,"I spoke to someone this morning who was quite adamant no flights have been booked, but I have a booking email from EuroWings"
Neutral,"Thats what I thought, I asked for a voucher and the lady told me I didnâ??t need one. Back to being on hold again!"
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK just been told by exp staff i donâ??t need a coupon to use nectar points, can just put in nectar number online, is this true?"
Negative,at no point have I seen the attached piece of information with booking fees this must be from a back end system #misleading
Positive,unhappy please can I have the callback I was promised but never happened your site categorically said thus was included
Positive,"@ExpediaUK If I unsubscribe from emails will I still get important ones about my trip? Bit fed up of ""book now"" ones when I already have."
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK booked flights with you London-Prague with SmartWings. Can't find them on Manage My Booking page, need to know baggage allowance?"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Dscvrd flight you gave me doesn't include hold luggage! I booked a 2 wk trip - and you think I'm just taking hand luggage???
Negative,"Expedia provide the worst customer experience,  4 weeks and waiting for a resolution,  hotels advertise falsely"
Negative,"@ExpediaUK you need to sort out your payment method, the price changed on me  from trip summary to receipt without a warning. Bad service!!!"
Negative,"Your website is having major issues still. Says it can't find direct flights... but, fyi, I haven't requested them."
Neutral,thanks for the call yesterday.  It was appreciated. Let's see what this weekend brings!
Positive,@ExpediaUK easy to use and navigate around! Only recommendation I can think of is they could email reminders of hotel details closer to hol
Positive,"thank you so so much for all of your help with this and so quickly. I really, really appreciate it. Very reassuring"
Neutral,"thank you for your contact. We are hoping your customer service are going to sort this out, been on phone to them this evening."
Neutral,@ExpediaUK I need to urgently reschedule a flight & your customer service phone line is constantly engaged. Please help!
Neutral,@ExpediaUK ive sent a complaint and a request in over a week ago & heard nothing.Its holding up a refund from the hotel!! #verydisappointed
Negative,my itinerary number is 111315408423 there are lots of notes and a huge email explaining everything. As I said shocking service .
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK Have I tried? I've been passed from department to department for the past 3 months, search my name check the notes on my account."
Negative,"Hi Nathan, sorry if you feel this way. Have you tried contacting our Customer Service Team at 03301231235? Thanks ^JY"
Positive,Spoke with them (for an hour). Expedia are marketing a flight that doesn't actually exist. The companies mistake now makes sense.
Positive,heres the email received. We were promised 2 nights of our hotel cost refund AND a Â£100 voucher - minimum
Positive,"Well as it's an online booking and the mistake of Expedia, I expect this situation to be resolved online via email support."
Positive,"get. And alongside that, at no point did anybody agree to the refund. I expect a fairly rapid response to this as it's ridiculous"
Positive,@ExpediaUK Why have you processed me with a Â£75 refund i didnt ask for and didnt accept?! For a start it is less than u suggested we would..
Neutral,I'm abroad & don't have access to a phone. Will someone reply to my emails about this today? Thanks
Positive,"@ExpediaUK. Exceptional responsive service from #SeaportBostonHotel. Highly recommend. Arhhhhh tea, best drink of the day "
Negative,@ExpediaUK was slow to answer my complaint. Then their response was unintelligible. Anyone else had similar experience?
Positive,Thank you. I've just sent a DM with the itinerary number. Did you need anything else? Appreciate there are t&c's its just gutting
Negative,yes I did called 3times only to be told an email had been sent (never received) & nothing can be done...no refund or rebooking 
Positive,"thank you for response, you have been helpful I just hope to get it sorted as soon as possible!"
Neutral,"yes I have,it could be up to 10 days for a reply and due to the large sum of money involved I need it sorted immediately please"
Neutral,I made a genuine mistake on the booking date for a hotel and have had no understanding or help to try and amend this. Can u help?
Negative,@ExpediaUK worst customer service I have ever received!Never use!!Due refund & compensation for ridiculous service asap and getting nowhere!
Positive,@ExpediaUK awful experience. I have been waiting 25 days for a refund even after numerous calls. Quick to take my money as well!!
Negative,"@ExpediaUK your customer service is an absolute joke. We've chased and chased your cs team with no response back, utter nightmare."
Negative,- your brand your name your site got the revenue as much as you blame others this is a EXPEDIA issue
Neutral,"I understand that, but in the space of 5 seconds?"
Neutral,I've cancelled with you & booked direct with hotel for price you first quoted 
Positive,"@ExpediaUK Hi! If I book one of your New York hotels that does already include the taxes, right? There's no mention so want to check :)"
Positive,It would have been good to email me the details first - so I had the facts going into the conversation
Negative,@ExpediaUK i have been asked to get in touch with you. I had a call from someone called luke on your social media team and missed the call
Neutral,I know it's a @united but no one seems to be taking into account that I can only use dates in school holidays
Neutral,they can't do anything either. I'm just going round in circles.
Neutral,@united yes we contacted them they were absolutely no help
Neutral,Virgin flies there direct from London so why isn't it on Expedia?
Neutral,your sales team told me it was a marketing issue. Really??! Simple question.
Neutral,I don't have a sales query. I just wanted to know why Cuba isn't a destination covered by Expedia!
Negative,"no, I have just called the number and had a terrible time trying to get a simple answer. Can you find out and DM me?"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK I just wanted to know why your website won't recognise Cuba as a destination...
Neutral,@ExpediaUK am having absolutely terrible customer service on phone from your customer support team. Truly awful. Can you help?
Neutral,"@expediaUK Hi; can you help with an urgent enquiry about my itinerary, please? travel@support's response target of 48hrs may be too late."
Neutral,@ExpediaUK check out our amazing pool! What a shame no-one told us it's closed for 5 of 7 days of our holiday in advance. #notgoodenough
Positive,@ExpediaUK Surin - interesting city. You`ll find some older temples & an really top National Museum. Accommodation good. Love Expedia! +++++
Neutral,@ExpediaUK 
Neutral,Email sent 6 days ago yet still no response? Your website states responses will be received within 48hrs.
Positive,have now cancelled. Will book with significantly cheaper supplier.
Positive,will just cancel and book with cheaper supplier.
Negative,Claimed previously. Missed change in small print making claims almost impossible. Shame Expedia are going downhill #disappointing
Negative,@ExpediaUK I reported a fault on your site over a week ago & the fault is still there so I can't get the booking I require
Neutral,Thanks for the response. Can I change my booking by emailing instructions to that address?
Neutral,"OK, and I can tell how long I will have to waitâ?¦ how?"
Negative,first response back from this link has all the usefulness of a chocolate fireguard. Either misunderstood totally or brushed aside
Negative,@ExpediaUK due to payment issues between you and @Ryanair my holiday has cost me an extra Â£100 by having to buy separately. Thanks so much.
Neutral,What am I supposed to do if they don't understand my query? They're going round in circles!
Positive,"@ExpediaUK CS rep Luke is tops. Reliable, polite, understanding & v. helpful. Expedia will be getting my future custom and recommendation."
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK u need to check your software. Direct flights box unchecked,then refuses saying ""no direct flights"". BHX > Lerwick. LHX easy"
Negative,Oh but you do. Hotel booked through Expedia cost me the same gross amount as if I had booked direct with the hotel. Complete scam
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Love your unknown tourism posters - any way to order printed copies?
Positive,"well, there are discrepancies and most packages are cheaper with ebookers so will use them instead."
Neutral,@ExpediaUK just wondering if you can tell me when I'll be able to get quotes for September 2017? :)
Neutral,"thanks, will give it a try. None of the phone options cover this."
Neutral,I am following you. Just did 5 mins ago.
Negative,hi I'm unable to log into your portal. Can you DM me?
Negative,"@ExpediaUK have the most deceitful customer service! Telling us to pay the extra Â£160 and they would cover, then backtracking! Criminal!"
Negative,Far from it! A complete waste of my time on the phone to people unable to help with an issue you've created.
Negative,@ExpediaUK 1hr and 15 minutes to cancel the return leg of a flight where you changed the schedule by 6hrs. Terrible service
Positive,@ExpediaUK feeling much happier - thank you for resolving my issue so promptly!
Neutral,@ExpediaUK I have phantom charges of Â£10 and Â£3 on my CC bill from you. No indication of itinerary. How can I found out what they are for?
Negative,@ExpediaUK absolutely exasperated in how my query to change a holiday has been handled. Who can I message?
Neutral,@ExpediaUK are very good at ignoring customer complaints despite DM's providing the details at their request 
Negative,@ExpediaUK I don't suppose you have these available anywhere at higher resolution? They are pretty fantastic! http://www.expedia.co.uk/vc/unknowntourism â?¦
Positive,"hi there, I don't want to have to ignore them, I don't want to receive them at all - I'd hate to have to mark them as spam."
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK I really don't want to give feedback on my stay, you can stop emailing me now thanks."
Positive,"@ExpediaUK love the app, never disappoints "
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK How do I change the name on a ticket to their full name? Sam to Samuel, for example. Unless Sam is still acceptable of course."
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK your email customer support team is absolutely useless!! Not helping whatsoever about a problem with an upcoming trip, fuming."
Neutral,@ExpediaUK I booked flights and all looks confirmed in my itineraries but didn't receive confirmation email??
Negative,no I was put on hold waiting to hear back from the manger. I want to make a formal complaint will not be using services again
Neutral,@BBCWatchdog @WhichUK So no activity from custsrvs or tweets. Instructing a solicitor 2moz. Watch this space @expediauk-fraud
Neutral,waiting for customer services to phone me back
Neutral,Rajeev the manager was suppose to call me back can you arrange this
Neutral,@ExpediaUK i want to change the dates my new york pass is valid for how can i do this
Negative,it's even been updated on the Expedia website!! BA8728 has been changed to BA8730 - but unhelpful team says its not changed.
Neutral,it's not letting me DM you - itinerary no is #111515151778 BA cancelled flight and we can't change tixs until you confirm
Negative,@ExpediaUK Your cust serv rep took 40 mins while I was on hold to tell me we didn't have baggage! Then tells me it's clear on the website?!
Neutral,"No, I mean the tweet you sent only had the first bit of the phone number!"
Negative,@ExpediaUK @British_Airways very very annoyed that at no point we were told we didn't have any luggage allowance and just got charged Â£80!
Negative,thanks but unfortunately doesn't look like I'd use Expedia again after all this confusion and lots of phone calls / worry!
Negative,airline said it was never cancelled. Thought booking with an agent was meant to ease the stress not add to it! Not happy 
Negative,@ExpediaUK I've have been waiting since August to receive refund. Numerous emails backwards + forwards. You seem to be deliberately delaying
Negative,@ExpediaUK what's wrong with your website?
Negative,Was hoping to reply via message will have to wait till later now. Also i have a screenshot of the error.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Hi anyway i can contact support via email or social media DM? I am trying to book something and it not stating the correct price
Neutral,@ExpediaUK RT PLZ? Renegade are on the hunt for budget-savvy backpackers who are heading to Asia this winter to take part in a new TV show!
Negative,@ExpediaUK not willing to refund or change the reservation because of their misleading information
Negative,"@ExpediaUK ripoff! i booked a hotel that has 24 hour shuttle to the little island, but it does not! its only private hire that costs Â£200!"
Positive,@ExpediaUK thanks Expedia we had a great holiday
Neutral,"Thanks, I already did but they said that you didn't track it to them."
Neutral,transferring up to Venice for 4 nights there after....
Neutral,
Neutral,Go.
Positive,ideal so I'll have to fork out more money on something that isn't my fault. 
Neutral,thanks. Is there any way I can request a call back rather than phoning? Or is that not possible?
Negative,@ExpediaUK hi can you tell me why I have been charged for 2 hotels which I reserved for buy now pay later? Bit of a joke.
Neutral,"Case ID : [REQ:M-14624398] there's been no activity regarding this for 44 days, feel pretty appalled by it all"
Positive,"@ExpediaUK what's going on with your customer services, after being knocked out at one of your resorts after 44 days haven't bothered withme"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK You sent me an email weeks ago saying I would get 1000 @nectar points added to my account but they have yet to arrive!
Neutral,"Yes, but the fact that you can give constant promotional offers of 50%, suggests that you are overcharging somewhere!"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK .....surely 2 days is long enough to update the prices rather than misleading me into thinking it's gone down again?
Neutral,@ExpediaUK for the last 2 days your website has shown a hotel at a lower price then it goes up when I try book it..........
Positive,#PLEASANT #Business #Customers #Life #Styles #Inspiration Here for #Higher #Level #Customer #Innovation #Serving
Positive,thank you for your reply I decided not to book the flight with you that's all
Positive,Many thanks for your swift response. I will call after work. Thank you.
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK hello, I have a hotel booked in NYC next month with you and Google is saying it's permanently closed - please can you help!"
Positive,"yes, after waiting 4 weeks for you CS to help they now can't... Absolute Joke. Massively upset "
Neutral,@ExpediaUK customer service is appalling. Trying to pass the buck on an issue constantly. Would recommend you never use them.
Neutral,tried to contact me how ?
Neutral,Direct message on twitter ?
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Tried to book two trips in the last few days. First took >1hr: each page during checkout took ~2mins to load. Now this on repeat.
Negative,"@ExpediaUK hi guys, all my addresses have reset to Afghanistan in your website. Any chance of getting a fix, worried about recent tickets"
Neutral,I don't hold out much hope. At least the person I spoke to says all your calls are recorded.
Negative,"thanks, but my issue remains unresolved and my comments stand. If you cannot support while I'm abroad, I cannot book with you...."
Neutral,@ExpediaUK no point booking with you if an issue (despite email confirmation) can't be resolved whilst abroad. 30 mins on hold - pointless
Positive,scan of paperwork that I printed 27/7 clearly says complementary. That's what I booked.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK why do have to edit all of 5 travellers stored in my profile to add title before i can continue booking my trip #crapbookingform
Positive,and now booked more tickets. Easy! Thank you Expedia. Upgrades would be the icing and cherry - glad Xmas and New Year tidings!
Neutral,"is resolved, my first calls on return to the UK will be to ConsumerDirect and the Advertising Standards Authority."
Positive,"refunding nothing. Suffice to say neither you, nor http://Hotels.com  will be getting more of my business, and unless this"
Positive,"receipts and we'll refund that amount"" your 'team' have now declared I'm simply out of pocket for the breakfasts and they are"
Negative,@ExpediaUK you've booked a room sleeps 4 for a family of 5 !!!!  Draw lots for who sleeps in bath shall we ! #stupid
Positive,@ExpediaUK call centre 'manager' lied to me regarding my refund and DID NOT EMAIL ME AS PROMISED.
Negative,@ExpediaUK I cant seem to add a hotel booking to my trips in the iOS app. Even with use of the correct itinerary number?
Neutral,@ExpediaUK is there any restrictions to using a voucher given by Expedia? I don't have the option to use when I am booking my transfer
Positive,@ExpediaUK a Â£40 bank charge!! refund still isnt in my account so bank charge will keep getting bigger! raging is an understatment!
Neutral,@ExpediaUK not having a clue my phone bill has went over Â£20 I was also over charged for hotel by Â£10 which has resulted in me getting....
Negative,@ExpediaUK I keep emailing & chasing to try and settle as instructed the failed car hire service you sold. Any chance of a response?
Positive,"@ExpediaUK booked with Expedia - quick, easy and so efficient! Now to book another return flight sector. With Expedia,  of course!"
Positive,@ExpediaUK Could you tell me if I can redeem Nectar points for just a hotel stay in uk? Or is it just hotel & travel? Thanks.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Can I book transfers with you even thought I have holiday booked somewhere else?
Negative,@ExpediaUK and still you have done NOTHING to resolve the issue created by the hotel cancelling my Expedia booking without warning
Negative,I don't think you do understand...and I don't appreciate the attempt to stop me from telling the truth on a public forum either
Negative,@ExpediaUK thanks so much for ruining my vacation with TWO hotel screw-ups in THREE DAYS.  #justwanttogohomenow
Positive,"@ExpediaUK you really don't care that my booking, made via Expedia, is not being honoured by B&B in Palermo, do you? really shocked by this"

Neutral,tried to send a DM with itinerary number but it says as you don't follow me it won't send.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK so it turns out your price match guarantee is a bit of a #scam even after verbal confirmation from the booking agent & supervisor
Negative,"@ExpediaUK your customer disservice agent was aggressive, defensive, unhelpful, offensive and difficult. I am so disappointed right now."
Neutral,This is what I am saying. It has now been more than a month and nothing has been credited.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK How long typically does it take for @nectar points to be added? Still waiting for points for flights more than a month ago now...
Neutral,@ExpediaUK please tell me how long it will take to activate my nectar voucher so I can book hotel for Sunday that only has one room left?!
Positive,@ExpediaUK Battling with your Price Guarantee form for almost an hour. It isn't working-hope I'm not penalised for now missing 48hr deadline

Positive,@ExpediaUK offering hotels for Â£49 a night all over the world! Worth checking out! http://tidd.ly/82e31266  #travel #holiday #bargain #ttot
Negative,@ExpediaUK Most patronising and unhelpful customer services I've ever experienced. Now I'm out of pocket as a result. Appalling.
Negative,@ExpediaUK when you've messed up why do you expect your customers to sort out the issues? Not one offer of help from your customer services
Neutral,@ExpediaUK why does the price change on every single flight and hotel package as soon as you go to book it? Goes up by Â£400...
Neutral,@ExpediaUK hi I have a voucher code but dont see the box to apply it when I get to payment page? Thanks for any advice?
Positive,@ExpediaUK great project! i guess many more to come

Negative,@ExpediaUK how come a flight is more expensive through you than through easyJet? 2nd until 12h January 2017
Neutral,...arrives. And you're travelling on Thursday. And you don't know if you'll get on plane or arrive and not have a hotel. Thanks.
Neutral,...they do have a record of you paying. So you ask for confirmation letter again. And they say fine. But no confirmation letter..
Positive,@ExpediaUK Hi! Would you be able to send over your UK press contacts? Thank you!
Negative,rent now before infested with Islamic vermin.
Neutral,"but if the charge to pay in USD is less than the additional price in GBP, i'd be inclined to do the former?"

Neutral,@ExpediaUK just want to take your hard earned money and don't care when they ruin your holiday as soon as you step off  the plane
Negative,vulnerable foreign travellers in another country and essentially ruining the holiday of a lifetime.
Negative,replacement hotel was incomparable and we were lied too repeatedly throughout the process by both hotels. Abusing two...
Positive,of the booking process. Will be seeking legal advice and pursuing a larger refund for at least 50% of what we paid.
Positive,@ExpediaUK please could you advise why my refund of airport tax which you have agreed is taking so long to be paid?
Neutral,did that on Tues. spent 33 mins on the phone with them and they couldn't make the booking. Deffo a prob. I'll try somewhere else.
Negative,@ExpediaUK your call centres are the worst of all time. Terrible
Negative,"@ExpediaUK trying to book Miami airport shuttle, what's going on with your page? Not been working for last 2 days. Ridiculous."

Neutral,you advertised a guest house we booked it and it doesnt even exists We've no accommodation so how can that be our fault #Disgrace

Negative,@ExpediaUK my account wont let me make any bookings. telephone support cant help other than make a manual booking.
Positive,Not sure 140 characters is enough....I'll be in touch on my return. For now I'm going to try and enjoy the holiday I have left.

Neutral,@ExpediaUK Might want to check your mobile webapp. Didn't load after more than 60 seconds. #Testfail #softwaretesting
Negative,@ExpediaUK 45min phone call later and none the wiser about managing booking & now told advertised free baggage is false. Any ideas?

Negative,"Sorry, I'm in a meeting and cant answer my phone. Thanks so much for your help, Its very much appreciated. Kind regards. John"
Neutral,"twitter won't let me msg you. After being passed around the UK & US cust svc for 40 min, I made some progress. Quite ridiculous."
Negative,@ExpediaUK you have completely f....d my holiday.  Ref 111504021176. Why should I pay new flights when you have made the mistake????
Neutral,"thanks for the quick response. I can't call as I'm in America, any other way of getting in touch. Can you not advise?"

Negative,@ExpediaUK how does one unsubscribe from your endless onslaught of spam. The unsubscribe option at the bottom of your emails does nothing!
Negative,@ExpediaUK why are all of your staff unhelpful in dealing with my situation. Why have they repeatedly failed to help resolve my case????
Negative,plus I've asked for a written apology which I expect to receive. Your customer service is some of the worst I've encountered.
Negative,"I gave them a ring, they said I wouldn't be charged the fee...but it looks like I have been. Waiting for bank statement to check."
Positive,@ExpediaUK judging by your twitter feed I'm not the only one to have a bad experience with your customer services team on the phones.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK I was told a manager would listen to my call and call me back in 72 hours. So far nothing. Call me today?

Neutral,@ExpediaUK please can you help with a luggage booking for a flight tomorrow. Need to book extra in!!!!
Negative,@ExpediaUK Having a nightmare trying to cancel my holiday after 2 unavailable hotel booking. Can't even get through to speak to someone!
Negative,@ExpediaUK how do I escalate a complaint to get a serious issue resolved? Surely Twitter isn't my only option. Getting nowhere on email
Neutral,"Frequently? 3 1/2 hours after booking, and it still says 5 rooms left. That's pretty poor."
Neutral,"Booked but didn't get one-only an email from the hotel saying they had no rooms, so booking cancelled. Site still says available."
Positive,@ExpediaUK Please help one of your B&B listings @Millers64Edin win a  @FoodandTravelEd award - pls vote http://bit.ly/1ha0MDl  and share
Neutral,"if you take half of a booking for 6 people pending off my card for the full week before the reservation, that's a charge lads"
Neutral,"so the rate I'm seeing as ""pay later"" is just a conversion of the set $ rate?"
Neutral,ok thanks. How does the pay later option work? Do I get a total in $CAD and that stays the same or can it change? Im confused.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK how can I book multiple hotels in the same booking?
Neutral,"..options and this ended up neither cheap, quick nor safe."
Negative,"..It wasted my time, I didn't get what I paid for AND my safety was compromised. I weighed up very carefully my transfer..."
Negative,@ExpediaUK I cannot begin to tell you how upset I am about the shared transport return I booked in Kuala Lumpur. I needed to pay more..
Neutral,@ExpediaUK - customer support is appalling. 9 days after lodging request- still no response. I'm still out of pocket due to your web error.
Neutral,hope you get it sorted!
Neutral,@ExpediaUK still waiting on this update?? How long does it take to refund somebody? This has been an absolute joke.
Negative,@ExpediaUK worst customer service I have EVER experienced. When am I going to get the â?¬500 I'm entitled to? Or maybe a reply to an email?!?!
Positive,thankyou for you fast service in resolving this issue! My faith has now been resorted in @ExpediaUK ð???
Negative,"@ExpediaUK  disgusting service won't be using you again! Rang up last week for a refund on my flight, to now to be told it wasn't cancelled!"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK looking at a holiday in the Maldives but they all have this secret extra hidden cost. Why? What's it for?
Positive,"No luck on refund so far, staff very helpful but hotel not budging on it. Got hotel details to contact them myself now #Funtime"
Negative,have DM'd number. Seems a shame that the only way to get a response is to announce it on social media. Bad business practice.
Negative,@ExpediaUK disgusting customer services from Expedia. Don't use them. Waited 6 weeks and not even a phone call #ExpediaChat #poorservice
Positive,thanks to Luke for excellent service yesterday - really appreciate the help!
Neutral,@ExpediaUK I'm trying to book a hotel in Inverness but it's not loading the price or the button that says book
Positive,"@ExpediaUK Just had my Nectar account hacked by someone at Expedia!!! Be careful, they clearly employ thieves!!!!"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK plz can u explain why I can't book H&F to Osaka for next year but I can book them separately for the same times?
Positive,"@ExpediaUK hi team, I made a booking and want to check if the D.O.B given for one traveler is correct - is that possible pls? Thanks :)"
Negative,@ExpediaUK how do I complain about how you failed to even start resolving my previous complaint? Complaintception - great customer service!?
Negative,Same experience: Â£8 refund for a +Â£900 flight and canceling wrong flights. Disapointing service.
Negative,@ExpediaUK it appears you increase the prices if you link to your website through @quidco. Surely that's just deceitful.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK just clicked on the buy now button and it went back to that page I dont want to click it again if you have taken money
Neutral,hi I've tried calling the insurance that Expedia sold but the line is not open on Sunday's
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK 4thly, the transfer I paid for was a minibus full of people and he didn't know where he was going"
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK 3rdly my bag has vanished and the only response I get is automated telephones, 'I don't know' and there's nothing I can do"
Positive,@ExpediaUK why can't I book a car for tomorrow? Spent the last 2 hours trying for it to keep saying sorry please search again 
Positive,@ExpediaUK Apparently people don't take luggage on holiday and have to pay extra.  YOU SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR! #ripoff #holiday #deception
Negative,spoke to your sales team and raised a complaint. However it is pathetic that your company is not responding to my complaint.
Neutral,then how can you explain this? I expected a payment confirmation screen and trip details email.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK your servers are terrible. 45mins to book a holiday. All spent waiting for your website to respond. Did my payment go through?
Neutral,"sent, please do actually make an effort to sort this for me. Would not have booked if you had said we need to pay Â£100 for 2 bags"
Positive,You've already had your chance I'm afraid. Just waiting on another refund promise now. Fingers crossed this one happens.
Negative,And I did have to laugh (out loud) at referring to 100% non-refund as a 'penalty charge' for my booking. Will await Tuesday #How?
Neutral,"Called and spoke to Anif, he contacted hotel but not able to authorise cancellation until manager is back in on Tuesday #HopeYet"
Positive,so I guess you didn't sort it out. Didn't even have the courtesy to say you didn't sort it out. So disappointing Expedia
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK hi, I booked and went on a trip in April this year. It said I'd get 1000 nectar points but I've not had them. Thanks"
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK for pay at the hotel, where the money is taken ""at the time of stay"" why have I been charged a week before"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK my Irish accent was a highlight.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK you haven't sent my flight number on my email so i cant check in 
Neutral,@ExpediaUK still got problems. Hotel demanding money. Your help desk is not helping. Very upset. Spending more time on phone than on hols!
Positive,@ExpediaUK just spoke to call centre and they were fantastic and resolved my issue very quickly. Outstanding customer service!
Positive,No I haven't heard back from you since I received acknowledgement of complaint escalation. You said it would be 48hrs It's 11days
Negative,...or watch bulls being killed...
Positive,"@ExpediaUK helpful (!) total duration of calls: more than 6 hours for almost  1 month. I've contacted through emails, too. Result? Nothing!"
Positive,@ExpediaUK have to say a huge thank you to Luke in your customer care - superb & thoughtful & sorted the issue we are all booked!! #Dublin
Negative,the streets will run red with the tomatoes of your enemies
Neutral,thanks for the speedy reply. Tried to DM but  said I can't send unless you're following me. What's the best way to reach you?
Neutral,"Yes, I contacted them. They said I hadn't been charged. Still feel you made my card details, and therefore me, vulnerable."
Negative,A full letter of complaint will be sent to Expedia detailing the incident. Terrible service from all of Expedia. #neveruseagain
Negative,"@ExpediaUK totally appalled with your customer service. Flight was cancelled on Saturday, by you. Fly tomorrow and still no confirmation."
Neutral,Thank you Expedia for refunding promptly when I raised complaint
Positive,@ExpediaUK wall of places. Thank you @FindaTechJob for last night.
Positive,@ExpediaUK also told an email to confirm refund had been sent but still hasn't arrived. Why do your emails take up to 24 hrs to arrive?
Positive,@ExpediaUK also promised that refund has been now processed - but this was the case last time. What is going on?
Neutral,@ExpediaUK just spoken to 1 of your team for 3rd time to process a refund from 5 wks ago. No explanation as to what the delay has been.
Neutral,what are the chances that they put this one up!! 
Neutral,I did and you told me to contact Expedia uk who I contacted and they told me they'd send me an email but they haven't.. Ergh
Negative,"@ExpediaUK your customer service is appalling, do I have to kick off and rant for some help?"
Neutral,"I have sent you all the details, I have emailed your office this morning also"
Neutral,"tried twice on the phone, 1st cut me off, nothing they could do on 2nd call, send an email to be looked at after hotel booking"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK just paid online booking fees when I haven't reserved seats! Please confirm why!?
Neutral,1 hour and still no reply
Neutral,@ExpediaUK ....refund must be paid within 7 days?
Positive,@ExpediaUK why do your flight refund for cancellation emails say that refunds can take up to 10 weeks when eu regulation say the ......
Neutral,I can't send DM if you don't follow me
Neutral,@ExpediaUK what is going on with car hire customer service?? 2 hours and still no reason for a non requested cancellation
Neutral,of course. I have a VIP elite+ account status with you but never appears to be active when I arrive at hotels.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Still waiting for a response on my VIP elite+ account status. I've called and emailed loads of times now and its a month later :(
Negative,"@ExpediaUK I've complained about a botched booking 3 times now, taken 2 surveys and sent 2 complaint emails. Received no reply. Pathetic"
Neutral,"@ExpediaUK thanks for your help, query resolved! Will book again!"
Negative,@ExpediaUK so angry with Expedia! Falsely advertised a hotel and won't take responsibility for it! Transfer now!! Customer service is awful
Positive,eventually spoke to a lovely customer service operative who resolved the matter. Shall avoid online help  in future.
Neutral,The no is #7201524715859 and have been told escalated with reference S127628049
Negative,@expediaUK why does your customer services centre put your clients on hold for 30mins instead of dealing with the issue?
Negative,@ExpediaUK please ask your customer service team in Bangalore to take me off hold. @ExpediaUK Ruining my last day of holiday
Neutral,is this the same customer service I have been on hold to for last 30 minutes
Neutral,@ExpediaUK please can customer services take me off hold and speak to me
Neutral,i cant DM you. You need to follow me.
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Hi  - can I book multi-destination flights on your site - instead of just a standard return journey please?
Neutral,just spoken to your customer service team and 4 weeks down the line theres not even a note in the booking to show a complaint
Positive,Thanks for sorting all of this out.  Much happier now.
Positive,"@ExpediaUK forgot to book my altered return flight, and still expect me to pay the change fee.  Amazing."

Negative,@ExpediaUK I have been trying to book a Â£3000 trip with you for over 2 hours now. What a terrible site and experience...will go elsewhere.

Positive,@ExpediaUK hi it is now Thursday. Thank you for not calling me back as you said you would. Fantastic customer service. Resolved issue myself
Negative,"@ExpediaUK very very very disappointed with customer services , lack of help trying to sort an issue that is not my mistake"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Maybe a call to the ombudsman may shift it along a bit quicker. No substituting a call centre in country of origin!
Negative,"@ExpediaUK Absolute waste of time. So I have your relocations team, and they cannot send an email??? Really??? #EpicFail"
Neutral,@ExpediaUK Due to the service I received this is my first & last time I will use Expedia.Customer service is horrific. Never recommending it

Positive,@ExpediaUK after you took more than Â£1000 & cleared out my account I find out from my bank that you haven't even tried to return my money!
Neutral,@ExpediaUK we haven't been able to check in online for our flight. Will it be ok to do so at the airport with our Expedia confirmation?
Neutral,@ExpediaUK you changed a hotel price I was booking to a higher price when I was paying then continued to advertise it at lower price.

Neutral,@ExpediaUK I have the email - but where you say you have added vouchers to my account - the vouchers are not showing and are not usable.
Positive,@ExpediaUK how is that even right to take customers money but not give them the holiday in return. Sounds like fraud. We're not impressed
Neutral,@ExpediaUK ...and then after spending 2hrs on the phone to customer services still nothing was resolved!
Negative,@ExpediaUK ..your system crashed whilst booking. Taking our money yet not actually booking the holiday!!!!!  no confirmation whatsoever
Positive,"@ExpediaUK I hope you do, if handled correctly I may consider using you in the future!"
