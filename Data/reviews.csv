Review Expedia - Positive
",Travelled to USA with my family .Got the best deal for a hotel with Expedia which even the hotel could not match. Have used them in the past while travelling solo.Flights I booked via Appleflights.co.ukI rang the hotel to re confirm my bookings & they had it confirmed .I am back from my travel & everything went smooth .Will continue using Expedia & recommend others too !Thanks

Refund nightmare
","Wanted to book a multi-trip flight however the flights were continuously being changed so I had no choice but to cancel. Refund was confirmed immediately and I was informed it may be 7 - 10 days. 18 days later there was still no sign of a refund so I had to call a number that charged to further querie the situation. I was put on hold numerous times and was eventually told that they ""had a technical error"" which meant my refund request was never processed and am now having to wait a further ""5 - 7 days""Absolutely aweful experience - would never recommend nor use again."

I used to enjoy Expedia holidays but a recent experience has changed that
","I have always enjoyed Expedia holidays and found them stress-free - however I've just had cause to contact customers services and my view has changed.  I received very pleasant acknowledgments of the emails I sent, promising action, but there's been absolutely no follow-up .  It's a relatively minor thing of a shuttle bus not turning up transport us from hotel to airport - ultimately not their fault - but what they are avoiding is taking any responsibility.  Incorrect approach as they collected the money from us and are the agents. I am so disappointed, as I now wonder what would happen if there were bigger problems...Here is my case number 17236485.  Itinerary Number was 7245908583508.Dear 'SS'You said your customer service team would research and get back to me on the subject of a missing refund.  Here is the response I received:Dear Jeanette,Thanks for contacting Expedia UK on Trustpilot regarding your complaint about transfers in Lisbon. We're sorry to know that your experience with the transfer service provider did not live up to your expectations.This is not the type of service we expect from our suppliers and we further apologise for the delay in response to your emails. Rest assured, we take your feedback seriously and shall be worked upon for improvement of services. We tried calling you at 07505623#etc to discuss this matter with you but the calls went unanswered. Kindly let us know your preferred time we can reach you at. Kind Regards,Ravi,Customer Escalations AgentExpedia Social Media TeamHere's my version of events:There was ONE missed call on my phone whilst I was working and no message was left. I didn't return the call because it was an unknown overseas number. If the phone is engaged I would expect someone to try a second time. And cust service have gone and assigned a new case number to this...losing all the history from the original case (I still have the emails) and ignoring a case that wasn't properly concluded. That is inefficient and also perhaps deliberately deceitful?  I'm unsure what their call will be about, as they have all of the information in my chain of emails. They have admitted they tried to call the shuttle bus service themselves and had no response, and the hotel confirmed we were not picked up, so the next step should have been a refund. I clearly wouldn't be going to this much effort if I was simply pretending that we didn't get the shuttle in order to make a small amount of money.  This is now about the service and level of courtesy you extend to your customers. I look forward to hearing from you and if this is resolved to my satisfaction I look forward to revising this review.  But until then the rating stands. And in fact it's sadly just gone down.Jeanette"

Booked a ticket from here and never again
",Booked a ticket from here.  The after the payment page the holiday did not confirm and went back to the search page saying a technical error in pink. However a few weeks later we find that it had been confirmed and we booked alternative arrangements.  Expedia will not refund the money and are not helpful.  The international call centre is in India where the workers do not understand the customers rights.  I would not recommend expedia after this.  Itinerary # 7273901848608

thanks to Expedia a near disaster became a wonderful surpise
","6 months ago we used Expedia for our 50th Wedding Anniversary holiday to Boston USA in mid September coming.it nearly turned out to be a nightmare, but as it turned out booking via Expedia was one of our best ever decisions!we are on a tight budget and chose a 7 night stay at Motel 6 both for it's price, and convenient location.it was all easy and slickly done ... then we got a very worrying email from Expedia late last night saying that the hotel had cancelled our booking for refurbishment reasons - they advised us to call them immediately.suffice to say that with 30 minutes they had solved our problem.they found a superb Hyatt Hotel quite close to the Motel 6 one and got us a King Size room for the same 7 days we needed ...the booking includes free breakfast, free parking, a complimentary shuttle bus to various Boston locations etcthis was a massive upgrade over our original booking and would have cost us over ?300 more had we booked ourselves,BUT IT DID NOT COST US A PENNY MORE - EXPEDIA FOOTED THE BILL.how I wish we had used Experia to book our plane as Virgin Atlantic have effectively ruined our holiday! please see check out my page at facebook by googling""carol ann browne author"""

Flight rerouted without notice, refusal to reimburse additional costs due to this
","I recently booked a return flight with Royal Air Maroc from Manchester to Marrakesh (via Casablanca) through Expedia. On return check in, I was told that I am flying to London Heathrow because the flight to Manchester had been cancelled. I was lucky as I hadn't parked a car at Manchester and could take a train straight to my home city (unlike the American tourists not he same flight who had a car at Manchester which they had to pick up before driving back home) However, this led to additional costs for a train ticket which I have been trying to get reimbursed - with no success. I was put on a delaying strategy being pushed back and forth between Expedia and Royal Air Maroc with some of the customer service agents being rather rude on the phone."

If you have a problem, be prepared to get ripped off - 7243064173907
","My Son and I booked return flights - SGN - BHX outbound 14/06 return 08/07 via Emirates. Through no fault of ours we missed the outbound flight and were obliged to rebook. Contacting Expedia was a nightmare and possible oy by telephone. We were first advised that a $200 per person fee would be applied, but then passed to a second individual who advised us that the change would cost an additional fee of $757.40 PER PERSON. Given that the original ticket cost was $685 per person excluding taxes and fees - RETURN, it can only be surmised that we were taken advantage of, in our situation. The original total travel cost was $2,271.60. The revised Expedia cost was $3,786.40 !!My complaint to Expedia elicited a copy and paste reply, which totally failed to address the points made in my email."

Terrible Experience!!!
","I just booked a hotel for August 15-August 17 in Paris, France for 66 pounds. However, when I received the hotel confirmation it gave me the dates of July 13 to July 14 which is today but thats not what I requested on the calendar. The calendar had this date automatically set up and I manually changed it to August 15- August 17. Apparently, the Expedia website did not refresh to these dates which caused this error. I called Expedia right away notifying them of this error and they proceeded to call the hotel, the hotel advised them that for AUGUST 15-AUGUST 17 the hotel would be 232 pounds, which is way to expensive to me!!! I'm just a international student going to visit for 2 nights and trying to find the cheapest thing out there. If I wanted 200 pound hotel then that's what I would have booked. The first attendant advised me that he will advise his superior of the issue and they will call me back, however the call dropped while he was finishing the call. I called back again and got a different attendant. I asked him if he could see my call on record, this way I don't have to repeat the situation all over again. The attendant stated that the first attendant did not report the call and that the superior was not informed. I then repeated the whole situation again and the attendant proceeded to call the hotel. The hotel told him the same thing, which is I can only change to the August dates and it will be 232 pounds. The attendant stated that he will need to charge 232 pounds  to my card and then escalate the call to a superior who will call me in 24 hrs or so. I advised him that I cannot pay this type of money for a hotel. Aside from this, it was not my fault that their webpage did not add the correct dates like it was supposed to. He said that unfortunately if he didn't change the dates the hotel would change the dates and charge me the 232 pounds. I asked the attendant if i could speak to the supervisor on duty and he placed me on hold. I waited for 10 minutes, no supervisor. The attendant advised that the supervisor will call me back before the end of the day. I find extremely irresponsible that I'm paying the consequences for their webpage when I manually put the right dates on there. What I find even worst, is that my only option they give me is to pay 232 pounds like I'm rich or something. I am a struggling student just wanting to enjoy 2 nights in Paris and this has become a nightmare. Hopefully, the supervisor will call me back and we can find a resolution. Why can't they just reimburse me my 66 pounds so I can just look for different hotel. This is ridiculous, such terrible service!!! UPDATE: I never received a call from the supervisor like the agent had advised me. I will be calling them tomorrow. This is Absurd! The Itinerary # 7280011761666. If you can please assist, I would greatly appreciate it."

Poor customer service, failed to pass messages on from Airline, use with caution.
",Just lodged a complaint with Expedia regarding an aircraft change. Booked flights and hotel through Expedia. Emirates had an aircraft change and informand Expedia who should have informed me. They did not. Just as well Ive checked my booking. My wife and I had booked and paid our seats on the upper deck of the Airbus A380. Because of the aircraft change Emirates automatically changed our seats because they have no economy on the upper deck. I feel let down by Expedia. Be careful using them. Ive had some issues and trying to get them rectified is hard. I don't fly out to September and I have lodged a complaint but they don't seem to help. They just deny its there fault. I understand they did not change the aircraft but as my travel agent it is there responsibility to pass any information over to me. This is our honeymoon that's coming up. Now we're worried there may be more problems!

Embarrassing

Appalling customer service
","We booked a cancelable hotel in good faith with Expedia unaware that they would take payment immediately from our credit card. Our hotel stay was to coincide with Adele performing at Wembley. Unfortunately at 7am on the morning of the 1st night of our stay we received an email (sent at 2am) notifying us that Adele had cancelled her concerts - 7 hours after the cancellation deadline.I called Expedia immediately and had a very helpful operator who tried to cancel our booking with the hotel but there was nobody with authority at the hotel to deal with it at that time in the morning. He suggested that the hotel would probably make an exception as we'd called so early or alternatively he would try to get them to change the dates of the booking for a future date. The reservations department opens at 9am so he promised to speak with them and call me back.At 10.30 having heard nothing more I called Expedia again as I needed to know what was happening with our booking. The lady I spoke with this time was not at all helpful just quoting the cancellation policy. I explained that I'd had an earlier conversation (which she confirmed on their system) and that she really needed to speak with the first guy I'd spoken with to ascertain what he had learned from the hotel. After ages of holding she returned to tell me she couldn't find out who I'd spoken with and reiterated the cancellation policy. I asked if I could cancel the 2nd night and just pay for the first night - yes, that should be fine. After more holding I was advised that I couldn't in fact do that. She then suggested we could look to move the booking so we looked at diaries, confirmed our new dates and went on hold again. After another long wait we were told that indeed we can't move our booking. At this stage we were losing patience and asked to speak with a supervisor. After another long wait we were told nobody was available at the moment. We insisted on holding further and eventually spoke with a supervisor who was worse than useless. After much arguing and holding he concluded that there was indeed nothing more we could do and we would lose our first night stay - this was after being on the 2nd call for more than 2 hours. During the final wait we decided to call the hotel directly who, upon hearing the appalling service we'd had from Expedia all morning, agreed to move the booking without penalty. We went back to the supervisor who made us hold for even longer whilst he confirmed this with the hotel and eventually, at about 12.45, concluded what was happening with our booking - more than 5 hours since my initial call to Expedia.I fully understand hotel cancellation policies but having been given multiple promises and offers that we're then withdrawn and being made to wait for over 5 hours to resolve the mattter is totally unacceptable - not only did we have the disappointment of the cancelled concert we wasted 1/2 day of our weekend on pointless conversations, most of which was listening to Expedia hold music. We don't intend to ever use Expedia for another holiday booking again.Updated - Itinerary Number 7272600820265Update - following my review above I received a very prompt response via TrustPilot and telephone within 12 hours offering to cancel the hotel booking and refund in full. It's disappointing that it took a poor review on TrustPilot to get this resolution but I am impressed with how quickly things moved today - everybody gets things wrong - it's how you fix them that count.Thank you Expedia."

4th July All Inclusive Dinner Cruise - SCAM
","I booked a 4th of July all inclusive dinner cruise for my 40th birthday. Saved up and paid over ?650 for myself, my husband and 9 yr old  - a huge amount of money but I hoped it would be worth it.

Book directly, times changed, they have lost all the good features they used to have some time ago.In my case I hired a car through one of the scam car rental places, (please have a look on guardian website about motion green and their scratches scaam) which is widely promoted on their website so they can sell clients with a big comission and then turn their back as soon as problems arrive."

I'd give Expedia 0 stars if I could
","I'd give Expedia 0 stars if I could. Don't trust the deals, don't book transfers and don't expect customer service. They'll mislead you through adverts, rip you off then refuse to refund you anything worthwhile for your inconvenience or being miss sold. We booked a supposed '5 Star Hotel and Spa' which was a 3 star at best and half the facilities were closed the entire holiday. One representative flat out lied to us and said he spoke to the hotel who confirmed the indoor pool had been closed 1 day (we went down to reception and confirmed it was still shut). Imagine booking a SPA HOTEL to be told the Sauna and Steam Room don't work or have to be heated up 2 hours in advance! Everything was too much hassle. Then, the cheeky sods tried to pie us off with a spa voucher the evening before we flew home, as if that would compensate us. We paid for shuttle transfers that never arrived, had to spend an entire evening trying to confirm our shuttles would be there to pick us up the night before we were up at 3AM to get flight and a good day of the holiday trying to sort the mess with Expedia who refused resolutely to offer us any kind of satisfactory refund. Use Holiday Pirates instead or a competing service. They will absolutely ruin your holiday experience. I've raised several complaints and discussed it with them and they've just stopped responding because I didn't expect their pathetic offer of compensation telling me it had been 'escalated to the highest possible point' when it was clearly just a customer service representative or team lead. All we asked for was a decent refund or voucher for future holidays but that was too much apparently. Absolutely awful company, DO NOT USE."

Expedia is a faceless greedy ?
","Expedia is a faceless greedy corporation that cares not for its clients. Our recent trip was the last time we used it. First, we were told by Expedia that part of our package we've paid would cost three time more that was advertised. It took me three one-hour calls to convince the beast to deliver that part of package for the price we paid. It was just criminal of them to ask for more money after we've paid for the service. When we arrived to the destination, the service provider (contractor to Expedia) told us that they cancelled the booking with them (yet charged us full bill). We had to pay twice. 15 days later still waiting for Expedia's refund. 7265882980405UPDATE 1: Guys. can you believe this? After I posted this, a guy from Expedia called me today saying that they'd refund half for the service that was not provided at all. Can you bloody believe that? Please, at all means avoid this scam, never book with them if at all possible!UPDATE 2: OK, some days/calls/emails later my case was escalated to Expedia's concerns team, which was the ""actual Expedia"". All people I called before on the phone on Expedia's website were subcontractors with limited decision power. I had a couple of calls with the gentleman from the concern team and eventually received the refund. Now, think if you would like to spend hours calling and writing to expedia for a simple refund or you would rather book with someone else in the first place. I've definitely made up my mind."

My experience with Expedia has been the ?
","My experience with Expedia has been the worst I've ever had. All my flights were changed. No help was given to return me back home the same day I had booked. I was put on hold for a total of 4 hours over 3 days. Without compensation, I would never use them or recommend anyone to use them in the future. I have subsequently heard they pulled a similar stunt on a friend and cost her an extra 1,000 GBP. My itinerary number is 7247246939263 and to be fair I would forgive the company if they compensated me for the cancelled and changed returned flight."

Europcar at London Heathrow Airport.
","Europcar at London Heathrow Airport.I had booked a car with the named company from Los Angeles back in early April for June 27th. The price quotes and confirmed in writing by Expedia was close to $ 375. I landed at Heathrow June 27th. and went to Europcar to pick up car. The price jumped from $ 375 to close to $ 860. and on top of that I was asked to pay $ 320 insurance. I had already paid Expedia $ 220 towards insurance back in April.It left me no choice but to cancel everything and catch a taxi to my relative and ended up paying 60 pounds.This hThis kind of treatment has been experience by many with this company I have heard and one should not have to go thru this kind of treatment, especially when one has to spend 11 hours in a plane."

COULDNT BOOK FLIGHT/HOTEL
","Is there any point in me adding to the bad reviews here!!! They must be so used to it I doubt they care, but here we we go anyway.Spent all day trying to book a flight and hotel package but kept getting message:""SorryWe weren't able to complete your booking. Please wait a moment and try again""So I do so 5 times and still same error. However, my card was billed ?962 5 times, which wasnt even the value of the holiday anyway! Had to take a screen shot of my statement and email it in so their accounts team could cancel all the transactions so my card was not maxed out.Customer service said it was a Ryan Air problem on the flight part of the package. What all day? I dont think so, I think you are a useless company with a useless website. Why ask me to try again and charge my credit card 5 times!!!???Every Tripadvisor review I write from now on,  I start with ***DO NOT BOOK WITH EXPEDIA***  Already started to do this over a different issue I had recently.I encourage everyone else to do the same as people should be warned about these time wasters. Perhaps they will start to do something instead of saying sorry.EDIT REPLY TO EXPEDIA:Case ID : [REQ:M-17518769]I've reluctantly booked with Hotels.com knowing that this is your sister company and booked flights direct with Ryan Air, no issues with their website.

Expedia - you suck!
","Very disappointed with Expedia. I just tried booking a flight + hotel. Payment struggled to get through. My credit card company rang to check I had authorised payment, and confirmed that some money (?500) had been taken from account for the hotel part of the booking. However I have received no email confirming this.I rang Expedia demanding an explanation - took an hour and got passed around different advisers. While I'm not fussed about the flight part of booking not happening, I have no confirmation about the hotel booking despite money having been taken off me. That is why I wanted to speak to Expedia. Their adviser were useless, tried to fob me off, I kept explaining the situation to them, but they were simply of no help. One of them told me to get some authorisation code from th bank but bank says this isn't allowed. I'm wondering what other lies Expedia has been, will be telling me.I am now waiting to see if I get my money back, and if Expedia will honour my booking at the price I was looking to book just only 2 hours ago. If I dont get my money back, I will go to the police. Enough of crap service and lies. What Expedia should have done instead of leaving a customer in a lurch with partial payment with no confirmation email - is to take money only when all parties to a booking have approved their respective parts of the payment. I'm waiting to see what happens, but I will certainly not hesitate to go to the police.As you requested here is my case ID: S-142934212. How do I know you will even refund me th money ? I want to rebook the hotel via another route but worry you will cheat me and refuse to refund me given all the nasty comments from other users."

Court Action Pending Refund
",EXPEDIA.....I booked a flight from St Vincent to LGW via Toronto for my son. I booked it on the 17/6/17 am to fly out on the 18/6/17 am. I was not informed that I needed a visa to fly through Canada. You can imagine my shock when my son rings to say they won't let him on the flight. I quickly complete the online application. But it's too late. Expedia said it's not their policy to advise on VISAs. I didn't want advice I just wanted to be told that I may need one. This is so dishonest I had no chance to change my ticket or have the right paperwork. I believe their refusal to tell customers is about maximising their sales. I will be going to court over this if I am not refunded.He's still in Barbados now as we're trying to get him back. Expedia just left me to get on with it. Unbelievable!I have noted your comments and do not accept your response. I was telephoned this morning by EXPEDIA. They confirmed that all they can do is advise me to check with my local embassy. However they didn't even do this. Had they done so it would have prompted me to act. To insult me further they have offered me ?50 compensation as a gesture of good will after acknowledging that I have spent a lot of money. REALLY.

If I could have given zero stars for my ?
","If I could have given zero stars for my experience of booking with Expedia, I would have done so.  I booked my complete holiday through Expedia - flights, hotel and airport transfer.  Flights and hotel were confirmed, airport transfer was showing as ""not booked"" with no option to be able to do anything about it, even though the money had been taken from my account.  I contacted customer services to be told they cannot change my itinerary - no idea why - and that I would need to email them to request a refund.  To cut a long story short, from 4 April 2017 to today - 13 June 2017, I have made 6 phone calls to Expedia, and have sent 6 separate emails to prove that they did indeed take the money from my account, and still have not received my refund.  4 times I have been promised that the money will be refunded in 7-10 days.  Excuse me for not believing it any more.  I have requested a link to the complaints procedure to lodge a formal complaint and have been told that they are unable to send this to me.  I am giving this another week and if the money has not been credited to my account, I will be taking legal advice.  I am so disappointed that this has somewhat tainted the holiday I have so been looking forward to as I have spent far too much time on the phone arguing over a refund of money which has been taken from me under false pretences.

Please note that this is the last opportunity - if I don't get any satisfactory response from you today then I will seek legal advice to get this sorted.

Between 12:00 - 13:00 UK time today.23/6/17 - an update - Expedia have now refunded me the money owed to me, so I thank you for that.  However, I shouldn't have had to take it to this stage.

Worst service you'd ever imagine!!
",I made a booking once got to payment and submitted order it came up error to try again I then tryed again to then coming across error again. I then phoned to book over the phone and got through to a very ignorant agent who tryed and also came back with the error response I then came off the call to check my bank account to find 3 transactions have been taken with a sum of well over 1 thousands pounds. I contacted Expedia straight back and was passed between 5 different sectors placing me on hold for well over 25 minutes at a time. To then be told the money will not go back in my account for 72 hours.

poor poor poor customer service
",This website is fine until you have a query or problem then your lied to left on hold for nearly 30min and yet you call the booking line and less than 30sec someone picks up useless and don't care once they have your money! Avoid better to pay more elsewhere than use these cowboys.Thanks for the response but I have already been through to your customer complaints services this is who kept me on hold for 30min and while eventually I problem was sorted it took well over an hour I will not spend another minute of my life dealing with your company its way too difficult.

Absolute Scam.
","Absolute Scam.Rejected cashback claim for over ?120 - claim the referral didn't come from the site I said, and so they can't pay the cashback through them.For that amount of money, I'm pretty sure I know what I was doing.I will never go through them for business of leisure again."
51,"Hi Mden, thanks for your time today. Upon investigation, we called the hotel to find out the reason why the booking was cancelled and as per them, they tried to pre authorize some funds to secure the booking which failed or rejected in other terms. In these situation the booking is cancelled automatically by their system. As the booking is cancelled it cannot be reinstated, have to book a new reservation. As there is no fault or error on our end we will not be taking any responsibility towards this reservation, unfortunately. We would really appreciate your understanding in this matter.

Confirmed Expedia reservation cancelled by the hotel
","On Tuesday I made a hotel booking for Lisbon - Hotel Vincci Baixa using Expedia (itinerary nr. 7271218806836) to receive today an email that the hotel room was cancelled by the hotel without telling me exactly why this has happened ""MOST LIKELY due to your method of payment used to reserve the room"". However, the booking was made with payment at the arrival (using cash, debit or credit cards), with no deposit required, using a Visa debit card issued by Lloyds Bank (used on countless other bookings and transactions,) providing booking information matching the one on the used card. It is terrible that Expedia does not provide any email contact details or an online service for complaints or methods to resolve the issue. I am currently abroad and calling the provided number would subject me to extra roaming costs. It is also unacceptable that the Vincci Baixa hotel cancelled the hotel booking now that they have the same type of room booking ?300 more expensively than the one I made on Tuesday. This makes me believe, as a customer, that my booking was cancelled in order to resell the room more expensively."

Lies, Damn lies and Expedia
","Quoted ""$ 83 Total"" for car hire on the website. By the time I had got through the various booking pages the price had gone up to over $800 due to taxes, surcharges and fees.

Worst Hotel Booking Experience
","We had Hotel booking at Ibis hotel, Noisy Le Grand, Paris through Expedia.  We had paid for the reservation a month  in advance and notified you guys in a clear piece of paper that we are looking for a room which is suitable for the family especially with an infant who is under 1 year old.  We had clearly mentioned that we need the baby crib for us as we have an infant who is under one year old.The day we reached at the hotel, we got extremely shocked when we saw the room size, there is no space to keep the suitcases and to keep our footwear, cannot open the window at all, the furniture was damaged where we can keep our laptop or tablet, plus there is no bath towel, no soap to wash hands, no refrigerator, no Kettle to warm the water to make coffee, the linens were really dirty and was bit teared because of burnt of cigarette, they do not provide the cribs for infants at all as this is not the part of their services. It was literally impossible for us to stay in that condition of room even for a single minute. There was flies flying around the room and smell of dirt.These are the basic needs of the hotel, which all the hotels need to provide, but they do not provide at all, it means I was not even told after we made a booking for the same that they don't have the baby cribs facility at all in the hotel plus they do not provide any bath towels or any soap to wash hands at all. It means this guys have cheated me and ripped me off, neither you nor Ibis did not feel necessary to even inform me about this policy of the hotel, i must have cancelled the room straight away if this was the fact but you guys never informed me.  Plus the Air condition was not working in the entire hotel, my 1 year old baby and 7 years old child could not sleep whole night, screaming and crying due to hot and flies in the room, me and my wife were just calming down the kids for the entire night because of terrific hot in the room.I went downstairs at the reception 4 - 5 times to request the receptionist in-charge to come and have a look to the room, but he never came to the room and started showing the attitude and refused to help and come to have a look in the room whether the air condition is working or not.  I said i am a customer and i have paid for the room and you must help me by coming in to the room and have a look in the room that how terrific hot it is in the room.  He became so aggressive, rude and angry.  His name is Faoud. This is not the way to treat the customers. Not acceptable after paying lot of money. If something would have happened to our kids due to this hot conditions, would you be responsible for it?I finally called Expedia at night time at 12.32 AM (lasted for 1 hour 46 minutes) I spoke to the staff called Ashish, he was really not helpful at all and just asked me to checkout and find another hotel.  This is not an answer to the customer who is in the trouble at 12.32 at midnight due to lack of services in the hotel, i must be reassured for the positive resolution.   He asked to call you in the morning after 9 when supervisors and mangers are available.  I again called in the morning at 9.15 AM (lasted for 1 hour 14 minutes) but no one is aware of the complaint and there is no notes left in booking reference about this serious issue.  We had to explain again the entire issue to the new agent, whom spoke to and i was kept hold again and again and finally i was cut off (Expedia staff hung  up the call).  This is extremely rude and unacceptable behaviour.  We are really unhappy and disappointed due to this.  We finally checked out of the hotel and rebooked the room next door at Novotel Noisy le Grand where i had to pay the double (GBP 507.72) for 4 nights.  This must have been done by Expedia by relocating me next door as you guys deal with that property too as per my information but i had to pay the above amount and do everything by ourselves by paying the extra money.  Because we did not want to screw up our holidays after travelling all the way from London to Paris and upset the kids."

Terrible website, rectified by staff member - refunded
","EDIT 8TH JUNE 2017:I just received a call from Sanchit at Expedia. They are giving me a refund (minus ?3) for the room that was booked incorrectly!!Literally the worst website I have ever had the displeasure of having to deal with!!BE AWARE!!!I went on the website, selected the location I wished to go and selected the date in which I would like to go.The website then showed me the cheapest available rate and I booked it.It was only when I arrived at my destination (past midnight!) and told them who I was. The man behind reception looked very confused as he had no more bookings due to be arriving that day and only had 1 room available (a disabled suite)Turns out, the room Expedia had shown me was the same room FOR A DIFFERENT DAY!!! Why would you do that? Why would you show me a room for a day I do not want to travel? If I wanted to travel on that date,  I would have searched for that date!!To make matters worse, the reason the room was so cheap is that it is a non-refundable booking!! So I am out of pocket, all because this website decides to change your dates!!And to make it even worse.....the hotel staff told me if we had contacted them directly we would have got it cheaper than Expedia anyway!!!!Itinerary: 7267515913008Edit: Thanks MK.

A Company to be trusted?
","A summary of my experience and unresolved complaints:-Having booked a return flight to Milan from my local  Airport through Expedia I decided to check on their pricing against the Airlines own website offering a few days later. I was appalled to find that Expedia were charging me some 70% more than the same advertised prices from the airline. What followed was a frustrating exchange of e-mails with Expedia. The Airline was supportive (more than can be said for Expedia) and confirmed, via e-mail, their pricing. I forwarded this to Expedia together with a screenshot of the Airline pricing some days later, still 40% lower than the Expedia price. I asked Expedia to provide supporting evidence of their prices, which they insisted came directly from the airline. That was April 24th. By May 17th my frustration with the lack of an adequate response by Expedia gave me no alternative but to ?go public? and expose the shambolic customer service and  what would seem naked profiteering.Responding to the standard Expedia reply the Itinerary No is 7259429070154. I shall report on progress (or not) so those viewing this report will have a full appreciation of how Expedia deal with complaints.And so it goes on ..... You continue to ignore the confirmation e-mail from the actual carrier that confirms their prices and thus your overcharging by some 70%. As this was a few days after I placed my order upon Expedia it is likely that the airline?s prices, available to the public, at that earlier date would have been lower, as suggested by yourselves in an e-mail of 24th April. They are NOT a competitor, they supply the actual flight! Reference to a ?live system? implies you do not have a verifiable Audit Trail. Auditors and in particular HMRC require Companies to hold records in a manner that will allow them to verify and match trades within a statutory or tax year. If you wish to reconfirm you are unable to demonstrate a matching between the above flight itinerary and your priced order with the carrier and thereby provide proof of that pricing, I will be pleased to pass that information to HMRC for reference. You may wish to reconsider your response.So there we have it for all to read and digest:-1.	Expedia effectively refuses to address a logical, analytical challenge supported by factual evidence. In effect they are saying let ?the buyer beware?, our prices might seem extortionate but you have the option to not enter into a contract with us.2.	They have ignored the challenged to deliver evidence of the carrier airline charges which, according to Expedia, where some 70% higher only 2 days prior to the evidence of the carriers charges ? they effectively refuse to co-operate. Draw your own conclusions3.	FYI there was substantial standard seating availability on the flight even several days after I made my Expedia booking.4.	Your attitude to customer service deserves wider recognition and censure."

Better off booking direct with airline- now with Itinerary No.
","You've now invited me to share the Itinerary No., which is 7261180465360.    Please take note of the following update on the information above: to add insult to injury, when the airline finally delivered its passenger to the final destination over 24 hours late, they had managed to lose the passenger's bag. Currently we are awaiting confirmation that a bag found at the Departure airport is the missing bag - even though that bag is listed as having been loaded on to the flight! The passenger is now out of pocket for emergency clothing and toiletries and the earliest he can expect to see his luggage is a further 2 days from now. Surely this airline is liable to provide some compensation for this unpleasant and massivley inconvenient experience and your help in obtaining that would be much appreciated. All I've been told so far by Expedia is that you're unable to do anything! Thank you."

Annoyed & Disappointed!!!
","Annoyed & Disappointed!!!I wanted to book a room at a specific hotel. I checked various websites online and found a cheaper price (?43 cheaper! for the same room+ breakfast) at Agoda.com. Since I ALWAYS book my flight and hotel with Expedia and have done so for many years, I got in touch with Expedia to let them know about the price difference. The gentleman told me to book with Expedia and they will refund the difference. As it was quite a huge difference, I was hesitant. After reading complaints about Expedia not fulfilling it's own Price Guarantee Policy, that put me off. So, I just went with a cheaper deal (same hotel/room but this did't include breakfast with Expedia. (Agoda offered this same deal but for ?4 cheaper). Hastily, I went and booked with Expedia. Two days later, the same deal is now ?18 cheaper on Expedia. Strange, how the other hotel prices remained the same but this particular hotel's price dropped. I guess they took note of my feedback! Good thing, I didn't book the more expensive room as per his instructions! Why? Had I done so, the Expedia price would have changed by the time I applied for the Price Guarantee, which would mean I may not be entitled to a refund on the price difference!I am just really annoyed and disappointed that I let my loyalty to Expedia cloud my judgement. Hereon, I will just book elsewhere if I find a cheaper deal.  Does it pay to be a loyal Expedia customer? Yes, YOU have to pay more for your holiday!"

Use to search and then book flights directly with the carrier
","I will try and sum up this amazingly long winded stitch up in the fewest words possible so I dont waste even more time. I needed to change the name on my wife's return flight to reflect that she had been unable to change the name on her passport since we got married. I was told by Expedia to phone the airline. This was ""doggy doo doo"" as many calls led to the realisation that it had to be done through the agent. Eventually Expedia admitted this and to resolve we did many things including: wasting my entire holiday listening to hold music, scanning passport and wedding certificate details and sending to no avail, visiting the airport and trying to convince the airline to change (needed Expedia), being called by Expedia - put on hold for 30 mins - and then asked to stop calling. Every call was like Groundhog Day with 10 minutes wasted before going on hold, but I realised this wasnt the most personal service was when my flight was due to take off in 12 hours and I was sent a mail saying ""Your query will be answered in 24 hours"". I booked alternative flights at that moment, and I have not been contacted by email or phone to this day. My query must have been ""Why would I never use Expedia again?"" as that was answered categorically at that point."

The worst place to make a booking from

Took us three consecutive days to try ?
","Took us three consecutive days to try and book a short city break. On the first attempt, three credit cards were rejected. It took 20 mins to get through to an operator. We then tried to book through the operator only for the cards to be refused (the operator either had no idea that no cards would be accepted or hoped we would get to the the end and just pay by their preferred method -debit). I was asked to try another card. Ultimately, after evasive responses as to what the issue was, a supervisor (having escalated the problem) stated that they would only accept debits. When an additional charge (now ?40 over the quotation) was demanded and I was told ""do you want to pay it or not"", I hung up. We then had multiple problems with the website on subsequent days (entering destinations that were then wiped and random locations coming up), quotations that had failed to compute (a ?900 trip for two persons quoted at ?400 that was obviously incorrect). After multiple glitches we gave up and booked through another site provider. It took 10 mins hassle free for much better deals. This service is staggeringly poor. Expedia used to be convenient. Poor user interface and bad customer service have made alternative providers a no-brainer. Lots of time wasted. Shameful. Never again."

Price Match Guarantee not honoured!!
","I have been using Expedia for a number of years and have always been happy to sing their praises. We have previously been refunded under the Price Match Guarantee with no quibble and even been compensated for a description error on their website. How things have changed! I have recently spent thousands of pounds with them and before I went away I checked the price of the hotels we paid for upfront to find that the price had reduced for 2 of them. The total difference was only ?179 but I put in the claim, which now includes uploading screenshots of the new website. I actually sent them a screen shot of their own website showing the new price. Even though I was told I would be contacted within 48 hours this did not happen and when I chased this up I was told my claim was invalid. Due to the principal of this I have since spend hours on the phone, sent emails including one to an escalation team that turned out to be the same customer services department I have been dealing with and promised numerous calls back. Needless to say that this is ongoing. Due to my experience and the experience of the other reviewers I think Expedia is on a slippery slope; I am sure the competition cannot be this bad!Expedia have requested I share the Itinerary numbers which are Itinerary #7249613385850 & 7249651379047"

Money taken but no trip booked
","My daugher tried to book a trip for her and a few friends, all their money had been transferred to her account so she could make the booking. The website kept saying there was a problem with her card and she should contact her bank,  which we did. The bank confirmed that Expedia had taken two random payment amounts which exceeded the cost of the holiday and had tried to take a third , but as they had now cleared her account of money this last payment didn't go through. Shes absolutely distraught as they have also taken her friends money. We contacted Expedia who appeared completely unconcerned.  We have emailed as well and they have responded saying it can take upto 10 days for them to respond. They have all her and her friends money, they still haven't booked their holiday and no doubt the price will have changed before she ever gets the money back. Are they scammers? That's what it feels like. Of course when you do a bit of research, it appears that Expedia have done this scam on many occasions with most people having to ring and complain for ages before they get their money back. BE WARE book through someone reliableUpdate - In response to your request for an itinerary number, I am unable to reply because, as I said in my review, the holiday wasn't booked as your website kept saying there was a problem with her card.  I do have an escalation code from your complaints helpline which is S-140630004.Second update - following your reply today (12 days after the incident), I am at a loss to know why it has taken so long for you to respond.  I spent four days constantly ringing Arizona (USA), being cut off etc, before I was promised that the money would be put back into my daughters account. Two more calls later and it finally was.  We will not be dealing with your company again, the contact centre staff are polite but ineffective, it is only when you speak to a duty manager that anything happens.  Sorry Expedia but this problem with debiting three incorrect payments from peoples accounts has been going on too long.  I have found reports going back 7 years.

No Taxi yet no refund!
","We booked a taxi to meet us at JFK and take us into the city (Itinerary # 7245463647506). The instructions on the booking were for us to call the company (SF Best LImousine) on arrival. This is what we did, however, despite attempting to call for 40 minutes, all calls went to Voicemail. At this stage we took a Yellow Cab as SF Limousines were non-contactable and our booking states that 'Drivers wait a maximum of 30 minutes from your flight arrival'. They eventually contacted us, well over an hour, after we had left the message and when we were already halfway to the City. The return journey instructions inform you that you need to call the company 'at least 24 hours before your scheduled service to confirm pick up time'. So we called and surprise surprise it went to Voicemail again. We left a message asking us to call back to confirm that they would be able to satisfy this leg of the trip. Despite a number of calls in this 24 hour window, we did not receive any calls from SF and therefore made our own way back to the airport. During the trip back to the airport we received a call saying that they would be with us in 10 minutes!. We paid ?96.68 for this service and SF did not satisfy either leg of the journey. On returning to the UK we have contacted Expedia who have advised that SF policy is that they are able to be 90 minutes late and that constitutes our agreement. As well as being a preposterous notion, this is not mentioned anywhere in the booking confirmation that we have. They have offered no explanation for the return leg, but Expedia have advised that we will not be getting a refund!Please can someone advise who I can contact at Expedia ( not the Call Centre as the service has been awful) as I want to understand how they can deny a refund for s service that was not provided.

Worst experience I ever had. Avoid!
","Booked flight from London Heathrow to Beijing for my parents. Got the confirmation email and everything. Turn up at 16:00 which is more than 4 hours before the departure time at the terminal and was told that there was no seat booked for us, apparently there was a mistake between Expedia and the airline so the tickets weren't issued. Called the customer service 6 times and waited for 7 hours at the terminal. Some customer service manager promised to issue 2 business class tickets to us for the 20:25 flight but no tickets were issued until the 20:25 flight closed gate. After more calls and waiting another duty manager called me at 19:47 to ask me if I want to get 2 tickets (promised at least business class) for the 22:40 flight. Then more waiting until 21:30 a different ""manager"" called me to offer me 2 economic class tickets for the 22:40 flight (up to this point we still haven't got any ticket issued to us). Apparently this guys thinks that we can all run at light speed and travel from the check in desk through security and border control to the gate (which closes at 21:40) within 10 minutes. Obviously we refused this offer and then this guy went away to ""find solutions"" like many of his colleagues did earlier. At the end a kind airline manager offered help to us so we can pay ourselves to get on to the 22:40 flight on time. So we waited at the terminal from 16:00 to 22:00 still haven't got any update or solution from expedia. Shocking service and try all they can to trick customer (trying to offer me alternative tickets 10 minutes before gate closes).

Flight booking
","Used their website to book a flight. After three attempts they put on hold on my bank account the flight price x 3. So the flight was ?300 and they put on pending ?900. I have made three attempts only because the message on the website was ""We are sorry but transaction can't be processed. Please try again later"". And I tried...The money were released after 5 days, which I think is unacceptable. In the phone they told me that it's a technical issue with the website and they can't do anything  to release the money sooner."

Initial booking was ok and done online
","Initial booking was ok and done online, I did have a challenge booking Hotel, Car and Flight as I wanted to stay somewhere else than where I landed, didn't seem to compute!The issues really came when I wanted to make some adjustments to my itinerary. This wasn't possible on line and the staff in the call centre did not have any information and had to call internal colleagues, who couldn't help either and finally the airline directly. I only wanted to change to an earlier flight on the same day same airline, it took 25 minutes on the phone. To add to my pain I asked to have my car hire start a couple of hours earlier, I was told to cancel and get a refund and then rebook online. Of course, now I was just booking car hire alone and so the cost was much greater. Will look for someone else to use I think. 27 Apr 2017 - 28 Apr 2017   |   Itinerary # 7258139419189 Andy"

Didn't have a single issue.

We have received the update from our Payments Processing Team that it show that the cancellation occurred quickly after the original charge, and was optimized, meaning that the capture and refund cancelled each other out and were never sent to the bank.

",Could Not Process TripI have tried to book flights and a hotel from London to Edinburgh. On 3 seperate occassions it let me get through to the page where you entered all your bank details in etc.. and then it suddenly went to a page saying 'Sorry we could not process your request.'

I did this trying different combinations of flights and hotels as presumably they were full and that is why it couldn't process my trip (Even though both the hotel and the original flights were options you could select!)

Booked through Expedia - Company overbooked flight and bumped us off then washed their hands off us.
","Airlines claiming people don't turn up for their flight; below is an example of what really happens. I booked my holiday (flights and hotel) through Expedia. We (family) arrived at TAP Airlines check in and were immediately offered to volunteer for a later British Airways flight that evening and a compensation as the flight had been overbooked and there were no seats left; we did not agree to take such a compensation and wanted only our right to the seat we had booked. We were then sent to another member of your staff who went to seek help from a supervisor ? we assumed because she knew that our seats had already been sold on. After all the fuss the staff sent us back and forth to the ticket office then to the supervisor until we were advised that we were too late to claim the compensation as we had missed boarding, which is not true as the flight was not for another 40 minutes. What an atrocious situation as they re-sold our tickets to somebody else, sent us home with no holiday, no refund and no dignity. Also, their online check-in did not work and we were not aware that 45 mins before boarding were cut off time.  The Airline put us as 'NO SHOW'; the supervisor in question was so undiplomatic and with no empathy whatsoever to the point where I lost my temper which I never do. We feel robbed, mislead, mistreated and very disappointed. Expedia did nothing to help and has a call centre in India complete with answer machines and hang up a system that is sure to make one furious, especially after several attempts to get through to no one.Hi there, Itinerary Number: 114370192380"

Expedia - Avoid like the plague
","In January 17 a family member, A, booked an economy class return ticket from Manchester to Brisbane with Etihad, via Expedia. On 23 Jan 17, as a surprise birthday gift, another family member, B, paid for the ticket to be upgraded to Business Class. I completed this upgrade on behalf of B, and received the confirmation email from Expedia which I forwarded to A, who was speechless with delight, as they will never be in a financial position to fund this class themselves. The money was taken from B's credit card. On 22 April, the night before travelling, A contacted Etihad to check on the chauffeur service, only to be told that they had no record of his booking in Business Class. He contacted Expedia, who advised him that the booking had never been forwarded by them to Etihad, and told him he could use his original and already paid for economy seat and they would give him ?200. The conversation was terminated without A having the opportunity to discuss this. The monies, including the ?200, were then shown as credited to the card they were taken from in January. On the morning of the journey, A was unable to check in on line, and contacted me in utter dismay to let me know what had happened. B was also devastated that their generosity had been treated with such disregard.  I contacted Expedia, as the person who made the upgraded booking, to be advised that the matter was closed. I advised them that it was far from closed and that the ?200 that was thrust on A would compensate B for the loss of 3 months interest, but that left A with nothing. Despite their best effort to fob me off, I spoke to Rupa Sugur who claimed that she would ring me back in 2 hours. She didn't. I phoned again and spoke to Jazz. He told me that the matter was with escalations, they didn't have a phone number and I couldn't speak direct to them. They were to phone me back in 48 hours. They didn't. I rang and spoke to Namesh, escalations were all in a meeting and they would phone me back in 24 hrs. They didn't. I phoned again and was told that I didn't need to keep ringing! Big mistake. I am absolutely furious about the cavalier attitude, the seemingly impossibility of speaking to a manager or the elusive escalations team. I will not be ignored and will see this matter through, legally if need be. Dreadful, dreadful organisation, don't ever use them. PS Their UK managing director is not contactable either, but the circumstances under which he left his previous position makes interesting reading.Expedia, In response to your reply, I have provided the details you require on every occasion that I have spoken to someone. The booking ID is ZN8LHH, Customer Service no., S-139662617 and S-139903629. Furthermore, I have not received the call that I was promised within 24 hours on Thursday 27 April. Again."

Pathetic customer service
","After having an issue with the package expedia provided with us (the hotel was not as advertised - and frankly disgusting), we complained to Expedia as well as the hotel. My first complaint to Expedia was almost 2 weeks ago now, to the email address specifically for post holiday complaints, and after no response I called customer services up and they told me I'd get a response within 48 hours. 48 hours went by, no response, so I called customer service again and was told I'd get an email back within another 48 hours. 48 hours went by, and you guessed it, no response. Called up again, was told again to wait 48 hours and once again no response. Each time the customer service assistant on the phone stated that they unfortunately could not help me as it is the post holiday complaints team that are looking at this case and they have no phone number to ring to get into contact with them, so all I have to do is wait. I have been waiting for quite a while now, with numerous calls to customer services to find out the status of my case and they have all been extremely unhelpful as they say it's with the post holiday complaints team and I just have to wait. The post complaints team haven't given me a response or update as to what is happening so I'm not sure if they even exist frankly.DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM EXPEDIA, as if anything goes wrong they clearly dont care and dont want to give any compensation for their own mistakes.Case ID: 16759583Itenerary number: 7239597471026"

A sad story
",Just came back from my holidays. On my return  I was asked to pay for my luggage 75 euros also traveling with a serious company like BA you will definitely have it included in the flight fare. When I went to Bucharest from London I went with Tarom airlines and I had no problems as they said that the luggage was included in the price and funny enough the note about the luggsge both ways was the same.  The guy from Bucharest who charged me for the main luggage was not sure if I had to pay as Expedia was not clear about it. I still want to get my refund. I rang BA Customer's Service Dept.and they told me that it's nothing to do with them as I booked my flight with Expedia and Expedia should be responsible for it.  Still  trying to sort out this probl. They blame each other. They were so concerned about me paying for the luggage but there were not concerned about letting drunk people on the plane. One of them was ill vomiting. This is Expedia and BA both to be blamed for the way they communicate between  themselves and deal with diff issues. BA is NOT a low cost company like Wizz or Eassyjet  and the main luggage was ALWAYS INCLUDED IN THE fare.

Expedia = bumped!
","Booking a flight through Expedia means you will be the first to be bumped! We booked a city break to New York flying from Manchester with BA with a stop at Heathrow and flying on with Virgin. Tried to check in online but was informed online checkin was not available for this flight, but BA now admits that is only true if you book through Expedia! We turned up at the airport to find we were in a group of 10 people denied boarding because of BAs aggressive overbooking policy and the fact that Expedia customers are not allowed to check in online like others. There was an alternative flight that would have got us to New York on time but they refused to put us on it due to the cost. The only option given was a taxi to Heathrow and a later flight to New York with Delta, which had a very big impact on a very short and very expensive city break. The compensation offered, a ?100 voucher if I book with them again. I don't think so"

Absolutely rubbish
","Booked through Expedia for a hotel in Dubai, Grand Midwest Hotel Apartments, for myself and my family. When we got to the hotel we realised it was not as advertised at all, firstly the room we booked was unavailable for some reason so they moved us to another room, and the room the moved us to was absolutely disgusting. Cockroaches everywhere, dirty bedsheets and appliances which do not work at all - this was an absolute nightmare and as my family and I had saved up for a few years to go on this holiday we were extremely disappointed. We often went to staff and management in the hotel to complain but they did not care at all or make any attempt to fix the disgusting conditions we stayed in.

","Please think seriously before using this company.  we booked our flight and hotel with Expedia we had our Malaysian airlines flight cancelled with 24 hours notice, we received absolutely  no help from Expedia to rebook our flight many calls to Expedia's customer service lines with no offer of help, indeed our calls were terminated many times, we were put on hold for 20 minutes or so each time, they informed us that our flight had been re arranged for 24 hours late when we contacted the Airline were informed that no flights had been booked, we had a 36 hour delay and had to re book the flights ourselves, we asked Expedia to contact our hotel and transfer agents regarding our delay and despite being informed that they had contacted these parties they did not.  To be blunt this company had no idea where in the world we had flown to and on which flight this surely cannot be right.  We lost two days of our holiday and Expedia have taken no responsibility.Expedia replied to my first post stating that they took my complaint seriously I received a Customer complaint case number 3 weeks ago but they still have not addressed  this issue PLEASE BE VERY WARY USING THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!!!!!"

WORSTTTT CO (EXPEDIA) TO DEAL WITH WHO FORGET TO BOOK FOR A MONTH
","WORSTTTTTT.....i remember complaining about the terrible experience we had with this nightmare company. First of all they forget to book my flights (jet airways flight), i was stranded at the airport for 4 hours on the phone with the company executives, who first said they cant do anything although i paid for my flights a month in advance. then after persuading them that its my wedding and me and fiance are traveling to India for our big day, then they are like oh what can we do we cant see any flights available whereas, there were around 4 flights available in that period of 4 hours. then finally after i searched for flights online which the expedia people didn't bother looking at even, i told him there are like 10 flights avaiable and then he finally after literally pleading him they booked a BA flight for next day to my worst surprise ever rather than doing something better he did the worse with us again, he booked a flight with one luggage only(our original flight allows us 2 luggage each) then we had to pay extra at the airport without any fault of ours cos we didnt have any other option. last but not the least Cherry on the top-  our seats were allocated by the agent far part from each other( i was in the front , he was right at the back - 8.5 hours flight)  .. No one ever bother contacting us for this worst ever experience we had.. NEVER EVER TRUST THESE lot .. THey are here to harass you and very easily in the end they will say , sorry we cant help you.. SO now its your choice if you want to go for the worst ride of life.."

Explore Expedia booking!
",Just booked with Expedia for an overnight stay at the Eglinton Arms hotel in Eaglesham for me and hubby. Didn't realise I had only booked for one person in room as Expedia site didn't make this clear. Ended up in room for a single person and it was totally cramped for two people.  Also got charged for extra breakfast but staff at hotel were brilliant and reduced price for me.

Beware or you will be awfully sorry and in a dreadful situation!!
","I would give no stars if possible. I am awfully fed up with Expedia, I booked with them however, never received any emails for my booking so I had to screen shot of bookings. I have booked 4 hotels in four different countries for a two week trip.  When I reached my second hotel in Latvia, I was told by the hotel my booking had been cancelled by Expedia. I rang Expedia straight away and I went through to 3 people and the last person said he is putting me through to some one else and then my phone went dead! Oh my god! I was in the worst situation ever, I knew Expedia won't do anything so I didn't ring again and am stuck in a country that I have been for an hour or so and I have no where to stay for three night! If your reading this I would say beware  of Expedia, I have washed my hand s off them. They have lost me as a customer forever. Absolute rubbish customer service!"

This company is really bad
","This company is really bad. We run a B&B and our channel manager offered us the chance to sign up with Expedia (promising more bookings). At the time it looked okay but what we didn't realise is that they keep your money for nearly 2 months. For example, he had a handful of bookings for March and were told that Expedia would pay us on April 1st ... It's April 7th and still waiting. Apparently they send the invoice on April 1st but don't actually start payment until April 24th ... WHAT!Plus, their mobile phone app defaults to the cheapest option (i.e. single occupancy) so the majority of the guests that we have turn up thinking that have a nice cheap room only to find out that they've got to pay more as they didn't realise that they'd booked for single occupancy. Expedia doesn't care that we're the ones that get the brunt of the guests frustration as long as they get the bookings. We will be canceling Expedia at the end of the season (we would love to do it beforehand but we've got to honour the bookings that we've got so far)."
126,"Hi Laura, I am sorry to hear about the problems you have faced while booking with Expedia. We have already received your post through our FB page and we have escalated it to our payment processing team. We are looking into it and will keep you updated from Facebook.

Where's my money?
","Used Expedia for the first time. Booked a hotel, but as I pressed pay it came up with an ""error"" that my card wasn't working. However straight away I looked at my account, they had taken the money out but there was no booking! I rang and like others on this website, had to speak to lots of different people! It seems some staff has access to looking at payments and some does not. Apparently it was a pre-authorisation? They said the money will be back in my account within 72 hours. Tomorrow the 72hrs is up... so let's see!"

Will Never Use Expedia.co.uk again
","So I booked flights through Expedia.Co.uk from Manchester to Miami, I believe that I selected Manchester United Kingdom and chose my flights booked and paid for them and thought nothing more about it as I thought everything was okay, that is were I was wrong, a few weeks after I booked I received and email advising that the itinerary had been changed by the Airline to my horror I discovered that the flights that had been booked were flying from Manchester New Hampshire of Course I called Expedia right away thinking that I should be able to change departure airport, I explained the situation to which I was advised that they would have to investigate the issue.  I received a response telling me that it was all my error as there was no evidence of their system.  My response to this was if I am on a.co.uk site and using a UK address and paying in GB Pounds why would I book a flight from America and why would you booking system not have a fail safe check in place.  ?500 out of pocket when flights are in September will never use Expedia Again"

I will never be booking anything on Expedia again
","I will never be booking anything on Expedia again. I recently found out that I was charged twice for a flight I booked to Croatia. Both charges were withdrawn from a third party payment provider, Netgiro. I called Netgiro to have the second charge removed and they said they could not find the charge but could further investigate if I give them my personal banking details (i.e. credit card #s etc)! Very sketchy. I then contacted Expedia who told me to send an email with my bank statement to their support team and they will get back to me. Still waiting for a reply...I'm very disappointed that Expedia is using untrustworthy payment providers for their international payment processing. Regardless of whether or not I get refunded, I have lost my trust in them and will never be purchasing from their site again."

False advertising and mark up of rates to existing customers
","Bought flights from Expedia which qualified for discounted hotel prices. When browsing hotels whilst logged into my account I was advertised a special discounted rate for hotel rooms after I bought flights. When browsing hotel prices whilst logged out I was being advertised cheaper rates than the special customer rate! I switched between the two to make sure it wasn't market fluctuation and rather just account log in. Appalling conduct to be advertising higher hotel rates to existing customers, surely this is false advertising.When contacting Expedia the only explanation received was that the prices fluctuate due to market, whereas in my case it fluctuates up because I'm a regular customer!"

She brought up my details and forwarded me onto customer service.The guy was rude and frankly didn't give a damn, he accused me of lying about having an account with them, despite his colleague giving him the information, and me having it logged on in front of me! He said bluntly ""Its no use telling me, there is nothing I can you have no account"", I kept saying I do, which he wasn't interested kept saying bluntly ""Can't help you"", too which at this point I was slightly flustered. He gave a snide remark ""You know this call is being recorded, so don't get mad"" so asked where has my money gone then? To which he said ""Not my problem"" and cut the call off.I had a call back from a girl who sorted it out, but will not be using them again, currently in the process of a formal complaint."

Failure to properly examine problems

Customer Services are the worst i have ever experienced
","For context; I have used expedia before without the need to contact their customer services department and flight bookings have gone well....beware though if you need to get in touch....Itinerary number 7224105444269I received an email from expedia asking me to get in touch with them urgently due to a flight change made by the operators, Virgin. No problem so far...I got in touch with them the first time and they explained that my return flight had been changed from a direct to a one stop flight. I explained that this would be a problem as my parents (who are flying) will not be satisfied with a transfer as they are old and find it difficult to cope with flight changes.I was then told the first lie by the customer service team, they told me that i had to get in touch with the operator (Virgin) if i wanted to make any changes to the schedule. When i pointed out that Virgin would not be able to deal with my enquiry I was then told the second lie - ""let me put you on hold while i speak to a colleague""...they promptly dropped the call.I rang again and spoke to a different advisor, they ran through the same details and when i explained the problem they magically said that i needed to speak to a separate team that dealt with schedule changes - that was new, no mention of that previously. I explained the problem to the scheduled change team member who then put me on hold while contacting the airline on my behalf (yes, i didn't in fact need to speak to the airline myself!). Whilst waiting the call was dropped after about 10 minutes of waiting.It gets worse... I repeated the call and got through to the same team - i insisted on giving my phone number so they could call me if the call was dropped accidentally. Inevitably, the call got dropped and no phone call was received - i can only assume that the dropped calls are deliberateI got back in touch - pretty disgusted by now and was short with a few of their operators...I got through to the same team - got names and also a direct contact number for the team - i got cut off again, called them back - spoke to different people each time i called despite asking for the same person. They promised to call me back with alternative flight arrangements given the situation - no call back again.Annoyed - i decided to call Virgin and find out what was going on - turns out that the flights have been re-scheduled for a month in October but a flight was available just 2 days earlier. Given that i had explicitly said that the dates were less important than the routing i couldn't believe that expedia couldn't have offered me this flight instead. Virgin couldn't solve the problem but they had told me how to solve it.I contacted expedia again today and have a resolution - I had to suggest the alternative arrangement and the CS person had to call the airline to confirm - that was it all done...Unbelieveable that it took me 240 minutes of call time when they should have been expecting the call in the first place. Their CS dropped calls, lied about their intentions, misled their customer about how processes worked. They made me work so hard to simply change flight by two days after a schedule change. Even though this is now fixed i cannot let this go without making others aware...For heaven's sake avoid - i would have paid an extra ?500 to avoid this hassle and stress."

Expedia owe me ?80 for fooling me with flight times!
","I booked a flight via skyscanner on expedia over the weekend and the price labelled was ?160. I decided to book this over the only other choice for that day as it was later in the day at 12pm rather than 10am, although ?40 more expensive. The following day Expedia email me to say the flight has been changed to the earlier time of 10am - but I didn't get a reduction in price! I called up customer service and they said well the flight has changed its time to 10am, though I will still be paying the ?160 price instead of ?120. I was extremely frustrated with the call centre who claimed that it was just a coincidence that the time changed and they cant give me the price reduction and that I should have clicked on the cheaper one to begin with! They offered no compensation or bonus as a loyal customer, especially as I booked one other flight and one hotel also with them over the weekend coming to nearly ?1k. To make matters worse I went back to Expedia.com and it was still showing the flight at 12pm. I am extremely annoyed with Expedia for this blatant consumer trick. The call centre was extremely rude, didn't let me talk and simply dismissed every comment I said. Looks like they simply don't care on customer experience anymore. I'm not booking with them again!"

After 45min of explaining to call centre that I can't board a flight 4 hours before my flight arrives at the airport, they finally agreed that this would not be suitable. Alternatives offered was then change to all my homeward flights which meant I would be travelling in wrong direction for 6 hrs and increasing overall flight time for 14 hours and again a connecting flight was only 15 minutes after the first which is not possible with a change in terminals being required..  Again not acceptable and took another 30min to explain that this is impossible, but they keep pressuring you to accept change before you can review properly so can't change it without additional costs. After 4 hours on phone finally agreed to acceptable flight change but with provision that I would now have a 16hr layover for my final flight with an additional cost of a hotel stay (instead of 4 hrs). This was despite the airline having alternative flights on the original day of the flight that was originally cancelled. Expedia said these flights are not available, however these could still be booked if you book direct with the airline and not via Expedia. Checked itinerary 2 weeks before holiday find that Expedia have cancelled my rescheduled flight but not notified me of this change. Again had to agree to flight change resulting in a final lay over of 24 hours which was originally 4 hours then changed to 16 hours to finally 24 hours. Once again can book a separate flight at additional cost direct with the airline that expedia state has now been cancelled.  Therefore ended up having to book a separate flight at additional cost on the same original day and time of my very first original flight itinerary.  Not only are Expedia helpline staff extremely incompetent,  but it is clear that Expedia cancel flights and reschedule your flights to suit them and the flight cancellations/changes has nothing to do with the airlines cancelling flights as you can still book flights on the same airline at the same original flight times. Will never use expedia again and will be telling all friends and family of this fiasco and recommend they are never used.Expedia blame the airlines for cancellation of the flights which is a blatant lie as these same flights are still confirmed flights with seats available to be booked, but only if you book direct through the airline at additional cost. Clearly a case of Expedia overbooking/selling their available packages and then changing your flights with no compensation in return."

Hotelier's opinion
","I am a hotelier and I am not surprised to read the comments of guests who remained in their hotel. I took over an establishment last year and it is six months that I ask Expedia to remove my establishment from their site because I market the rooms through another channel. Despite several exchanges, my establishment remains published on their platform and I do not have the possibility to block the occupied rooms. So I get confirmation of booking that I can not honor. I systematically inform their local agent who does not react more than that. This week a group of English introduced and I could not accommodate them. I showed them the exchanges with Expedia dating back two months ago. They did not let themselves go and (after 2 hours on the phone) got a relocation in a 5 * (a great deal so much better for them, but I was watching as they were trying to put me in a dorm!). I thought this story would have made Expedia react quickly but no, no action taken and so I expect their next pigeons."

","We booked and paid for a hotel room for a surprise birthday party been held there. Two to three weeks later we got a e mail saying hotel was fully booked so we couldn't have the room, the e mail contact phone number was disconnected so we rang customer service who tried to get us to book another hotel (never again) we were then told as WE were cancelling we could have a refund in 5 to 7 days. Hello...we didn't cancel. We then got a e mail saying how sorry they were that our plans had changed and WE had cancelled our booking. Checking the hotel had rooms BEFORE selling them maybe a good idea. Book your own hotel room direct with chosen  hotel"

What a bunch of jokers
","I tried to book flights via Expedia using Nectar points. I was on the phone for 90 minutes, being passed from one service rep to another (seven times in all) until finally I got to speak to someone who seemed to vaguely be aware of what he was supposed to be doing,, but then told me 'sorry, the Nectar website has just gone down'. He suggested I call back later, and when I did, guess what - the flights had gone and they were asking ?100.00 more than the first time I tried to book. I booked something elsewhere - if I had booked with Expedia using a credit card then I would have saved myself ?100.00 on what I eventually spent.. I have come to two conclusions as a result of this - firstly the Nectar points thing is a scam and they don't want you to use the points to buy travel, and secondly Expedia would be able to offer a better customer service by using a troop of semi-house trained  gibbons.I do not have an itinerary number as although I have often booked direct with Expedia before, this was the first time I have bothered to set up an account. If you look in my account details you will see that I searched for an EVA air flight on the 24th of February - this was the flight which I wanted and was unable to secure because of the incompetent way in which my enquiry was handled.

Mis-leading
","First time I've ever used Expedia and it will be the last! In fact, once I've finished writing this I will be writing to the CEO and ATOL.  I have just spent ?3560 on flights to Australia, which like many other complaints, conveniently increased from ?3450 when I place the booking!, believing that we are flying with Virgin Australia to find out it's all Etihad flights and I could have booked the same flight with Etihad ?200 cheaper.  This is miss-guiding to customers!!! So Expedia say's it ok for Virgin to advertise these flights knowing that their ripping people off is absolutely disgusting.  So I've asked for my money back... a FULL refund and I'm told no!! I have a pay ?100 per person to cancel because I should have known it was an Etihad Flight!!!. Taking people's hard earn money deceitfully is not something i that sits well with me and I will not rest until I have every penny of my money back! EXPEDIA DO THE RIGHT THINGI will be posting this on TWITTER, FB & EVERYWHERE ELSE THE PUBLIC CAN READ THIS POST AND AVOID BEING RIPPED OFF# 7245542737969This has taken my family all year to save this money for these flights and the anxiety you are causing is extremely stressful.

AVis Car booking via Expedia
","I booked an Avis car via Expedia and prepaid in October 2016. I confirmed with Expedia that everything was paid for in advance. On arrival at Dallas Forth Worth Airport, Avis didn't apply the voucher correctly. When I returned the vehicle on 26 Dec, I was hit with a US$260 plus $24 charge that I wasnt expecting. I called Expedia when I landed back in UK and they promised to investigate and get back to me within 48 hours. That was on 28 Dec. I spent over 3 hours on the phone with Expedia and every time I call they promise that someone will call me back with 48 to 72 hours. They are the worst at going back to the customer!I called and emailed Avis many times. They admitted that the voucher was incorrectly applied and gave me a partial refund. Today is 21 Feb and I am still ?40 out of pocket. Avis keeps telling me they will investigate and let me know by email only. It seems like everytime I call them, they are launching a fresh investigation. NEVER book these companies. I have not yet received a call or email from Expedia, once they take your money that's it, you're no longer important to them as a customer.I have incurred credit card interest, phone bills, hours wasted on the phone - just spoiled the entire trip. Itinerary # 7217109366666I sincerely regret booking Expedia and Avis."

Fraud
","I am an American traveling in Europe. I tried to go to Expedia.com but the site redirected me each time to Expedia.UK thus I thought they were the same company. I purchased flights with travel insurance on that site. Then i needed to claim on the travel insurance. I tried to claim and was told by Expedia UK i had purchased a service for only UK residents(it doesn't say this until AFTER you have purchased the travel insurance in the fine print).  I called Expedia and they said that it has nothing to do with them anything purchased from ExpediaUK even though it was their site that redirected me to ExpediaUK as a substitute. I believe this is fraudulent behavior - Expedia UK knew I was an American citizen not EU because it asks my passport informant when purchasing the flight. Thus it sold me a product that I am ineligible for knowingly.  What is also disconcerting is my confirmation is labeled as ""Thank you for shopping with Expedia"" hence the organization attempts to appear as Expedia  when its convenient for them(to pull in business) but then appear as different companies when its not convenient(to pay out on products sold). Awful big buiness tactics of hiding behind hard to reach 1800 numbers, with no respect for keeping their word or being straight with the law. On top, they are rude.Expedia has had awful phone customer service too lately. You get people who do not understand customer service and hang up on you. Avoid.Itinerary #7207752312059 and 7208039635377Yes you called me at 5-6 am before anyone wakes up in California. I am on PST please.Yes again you called at 7 am. I am not available before 8 am.    Please contact me within business hours 8 am-8 pm. It is not acceptable to me to call ten times at 6 or 7 am then put the responsibility on me to call you in another country.Update: I called Expedia travel insurance as your team in India called and told me to do and you said you would speak with them and inform them on my account issue to help me. They had no idea on my travel policy number, couldn't find it, and gave me a phone number for ""Expedia UK insurance"". When I called that number it was out of service. This number you provide below Verizon states call cannot be completed. More run around, pretending to help but really just putting it on another department or on me to call other countries and reach no one .  Bogus company!Update:this number does not work. When I enter it exactly as you state here it says""Verizon cannot complete this call as dialed"". So if you intend to address my issue you will have to provide a working number or have the department call me directly. You calling me seven times at 5 am over a week to then tell me I have to call abroad myself to speak to a different department and giving me a phone number that doesn't work does not help my issue."

TERRIBLE EXPERIENCE
","My wife and I travel a lot and this has been a terrible service which we have received.I had to change my flights due to ill health and I was advised that there were a number of change fees I would have to pay plus additional price for the flights and my health issue was not taken into consideration and the direct effect the additional pressure was having on me was not even acknowledged.Anyway, on 31st January I change my flight to 20th February and I find out on 16th February that they actually hadn't booked my flight, even though they sent me confirmation.Whilst trying to change the booking after 40 minutes on hold I was conveniently cut off and I had to start all over again because there were no notes on the system.... this happened 3 times!!!!!!!It was only by chance that I rang to make an enquiry as to how I found out and they had no idea, so basically I would of turned up and not been booked on to a flight.All together I have been on the phone for nearly 4 hours to many people and I was, on each occasion, promised a call back and not once did this happen.A chap called Ramesh picked the phone up today and I have to say he was very good and, although I was frustrated about being on hold for another 1hr 20 minutes he saw it through to the end with me on the phone.Although all staff were polite the service is absolutely shocking and as it stands at the moment I would not book through Expedia again.I have records of all of the calls.Luke"

MISLEADING PRICES
","Very recent customer of Expedia, certainly my first and last experience. We have organised a long weekend to Amsterdam, and were browsing for the best possible flight and hotel combination we could find. We managed to find a great deal for ?804.00 in total, which worked for us all and proceeded to put in our card details in order to purchase this package.Having put our card details into the system, we were stunned to see that due to ""a live system and rates subject to change"", our total payment had actually be processed at just over ?400.00 more - totaling ?1211.00! I completely understand rates can change, but maybe by at most lets say...?50.00. But ?400?! Absolute joke. After multiple calls to Expedia, they refuse to accept the ?804.00 price we know was there very clearly, in black and white. They are quite obviously deceitful entirely. Customer service received since was equally dreadful, the last person we spoke to being Mohan at the escalations team. I work in a role myself which is heavily influenced by providing good customer relations, and Mohan's effort is certainly one to be desired, his favorite phrase being ""end of the matter"" very abruptly when you are trying to speak - not shout - merely speak. Overall terrible service, wont be using again or recommending."

RUBBISH SERVICE NEVER USE
","I booked a hotel and rang to amend the date which took half an hour for staff to deliberate as to whether the dates could be amended. Eventually was advised I could amend my dates. There was a shortfall which was fine. I tried to pay it and the employee could not take my payment. He provided no reasoning as to why this was. He then advised he would call me back in 10/15 minutes. 45 minutes later I called, could not get through to the employee I originally spoke with and had to repeat the situation to a new employee. He was very rude and abrupt. Within the 45 minutes that the employee did not call me back the shortfall had increased by ?50, making it an additional ?100 I was to pay. I was not happy about this and changed the hotel room To a lower spec. Again when I went to pay the payment would not work. The employee was rude and not helpful. I asked for a full refund and about the funds in my account, which I'm told is 5-7days. I would never use them again. The service is rubbish and I wasted 2 hours of my evening on the phone to rude employees!"

Awful Customer Service........but they seemed to have redeemed themselves.
","Booked online for a Flight + Hotel package to a ski resort in France on 30 Jan 2017 for a family of 4 (2 Adults, 2 Children).  Return flights with EasyJet.  Another family of 4 (2 Adults, 2 Children) who are coming with us to the same place also booked exactly the same deal.  Expedia Itinerary came through on email stating Flights were Confirmed and gave a reference number.  Hotel was noted as Confirmed with property but no reference number.  Payment went through and I confirmed it with my bank.Received email from Expedia on 3 Feb 2017 informing me that the Hotel had 'overbooked' and that my request was no longer available and would I call their 8000283442 number to clarify.  Spoke to 'Relocation Team' who assured me that the Superior room I'd requested was no longer available but that there was a Comfort room available for me which slept 4 which I was happy to take.  I was told that this was dealt with and that I would get a confirmation through on the Expedia Itinerary.  This did not happen.Saturday 4th Feb I called Expedia UK Customer Service to get an update on the situation.  I was told that Hotel was confirmed, I asked them to call the Hotel direct to ensure that I got a Confirmation Reference which the Agent attempted to do but told me he couldn't get through to them but that he would retry and call me back.  This did not happen.  I then called the Hotel direct myself, and did speak to Reception who told me that there were two double rooms available under my name but they were yet to be confirmed.  I conveyed my problem and she said it was something that the Hotel HQ would have to sort out.  I enquired about my friend's reservation, and Hotel said that they did not have a reservation for her.  I contacted my friend who immediately called Expedia and the the Hotel.  I re-contacted Expedia to express my alarm, I was told to hold whilst they contacted the Hotel, the Agent couldn't get through again, even though I had only just got off the phone with the Hotel myself.  I was then told that he would retry with the Hotel and get back to me by telephone.  This did not happen.  On Monday, I contacted Expedia again, same runaround given again regarding trying to contact Hotel, redirected to Relocation Team who kept me on hold again, and couldn't get any straight answer at all but that they would call me back.  Surprise - this did not happen.  I called the Hotel again to get an update, whereby they stated that booking was being dealt with by HQ and that they would sort it out with Expedia.  I was very sceptical but decided to wait to see if this would happen.  It did not.On Tuesday, I called Expedia again to get an update.  Same runaround, put on hold, transferred to Relocation Team.  This time the Agent did call me back, informed me that she had spoken to the Reception of the Hotel, had asked them to approve our original booking (which was still showing as confirmed on the Expedia website), sent them an email and confirmed that the Reception had got it, called Hotel HQ to ask them to approve it but was told that the Hotel Manager had to approve it but that he was not on duty till 6pm local time the following day (Weds).  The Expedia Agent emailed me what she had done and asked me to call back after 5pm the following day as she would be contacting the Hotel Manager to get it all sorted.  I felt slightly more confident, but still sceptical.Yesterday, Wednesday, I called the number given on the email from the Expedia Agent at 5.20pm my time.  I got through to Relocation Team, who informed me that Expedia were having a 'System Upgrade' and that he couldn't call my booking up but that he would call me back!!! I protested that this was really bad service but agreed for him to call me back.  In the meantime I called the Hotel, where I was informed that my booking had not been approved by HQ and that we had no rooms allocated at all (same had happened to my friend's booking).  I was fuming!.  I called Expedia again, where I spoke to a lady at Relocation again who was useless and kept saying my booking was showing as Confirmed and that she would sort it out with the Hotel etc. etc. etc.At this point my husband had enough.  He attempted to do the same.  Was given the runaround again, redirected to the Philipines, told that because of the time difference the Hotel Reception was closed and that Expedia would call the Hotel as soon as it opened and would call us back.  This has not happened.Today, my husband is on the warpath and will be allocating his day to sorting this out.The exact holiday is still showing as available on the Expedia website this morning!What we want is for Expedia to properly honour the booking and properly confirm the rooms on the original booking to guarantee the rooms as per our request.  Or, if the Rooms can't be confirmed for whatever reason, for Expedia to remedy the situation by booking rooms of equal or better quality at the same resort for all parties involved.Please restore our faith by sorting this out today!As this is a 'live' booking, I do not want to give my Booking Reference Details on here.  Expedia - send me details of where I can have secure contact with you by contacting me at expedia at gwenno dot comThanks for your reply - as stated above, this is a live booking and I don't want to share my booking details on here as it is a public forum.  Please provide contact details so that I can get in touch with you direct.**************************Following two very lengthy calls to the reallocation team at Expedia in the Philippines, our problem has been resolved at Expedia's expense.

Horrific customer 'service'
","We are not long back from the most horrific holiday experience one could imagine, worsened only by the lack of customer support afforded to us by Expedia UK. We notified them immediately upon checking into our room that we could not navigate 30+ steep stairs with NO hand rail. We were told it was our duty to investigate this beforehand. However, I've never encountered a 10+ stairway in a 4-star hotel, or indeed any public stairway, that didn't have a hand rail so didn't anticipate a problem. So are Expedia are implying we should check beforehand if our 4-star hotel has pillows, sheets and dustbins? We were EVENTUALLY moved to a more expensive room (the fee would not be waived) which was supposed to be an 'upgrade' but the conditions were revolting and more befitting of a 1-star than a 4-star hotel. Expedia were terribly unhelpful. Did nothing to help us and offered us a measly ?100 in post holiday compensation. ?100 is like a slap in the face considering we spent ?2000 in total on truly disgraceful accommodation.

Don't us Expedia
","I booked the flights for our holiday to Malaga (Iberia flight operated by BA) last week on Expedia - six tickets all confirmed and received notice from Amex that payment had gone through. Then confirmed our villa and car hire, both of which are non-refundable.

No communication from Expedia at all.  Phoned them up and they told me the flight schedule has changed and the flights are no longer available.  This is a lie as you can still book online with Iberia (or BA) for the same flight numbers and times.

Upon investigation, I have found that Hotel did not notified us for the same due to which we were unable to inform or notify you about the Hotel update. This is certainly not the service we would like you to have. I really appreciate your patience as we also do not want to lose our valuable customer. Therefore, as a goodwill gesture, I have refunded you the full amount of your Hotel booking (GBP 133.50). This refund would be credited to your account within the next 5-7 working days.

Terrible customer service
",I booked and paid for a premier inn hotel via Expedia. When I arrived I found that the hotel had been closed down over a week before. I called the customer service team the day after for a refund to be told I should have contacted them on arrival at the (none existent) hotel. I didn't because it was late and I had to find alternative accommodation quickly. They then asked if I wanted them to find another hotel and I had to point out that they were a day late. They owe me ?133.50 ( ref 7240622377459) irrespective whether I didn't inform them on the day. They sold a room that didn't exist which they could easily check with premier inn. I can accept that mistakes happen but good companies know how to put it right. Stay well clear.
166,"Hi Takatoshi, I am sorry to know about your recent experience with our Customer Support Team and apologies for any distress caused due to the booking error.

Will not use again - poor system and poor customer service
","[REQ:S-131531012]I wish I rated them ""zero star""The nightmare was started from 8 Nov 2016 when I tried to book Hotel + Flight package to Germany via Expedia site. At that time, I could not complete my booking properly - I could reach to ""make a payment"" page, but once I typed my card details, and clicked ""pay"", Expedia system responded error. I called support centre, and they said that it seemed that Expedia site had  some system trouble, I should try it later. So that I tried 30 min later, and 1hour later, but still responded as error.However, I realised that I received two emails from Germanwings, which said, my flight has been confirmed though Expedia site didnt confirm at all.  As Expedia site didnt confirm my booking, no itinerary number was issued nor no hotel booking was made.Also, I found that two transaction has been made from my credit catds (I tried to use two cards, one is VISA, and the other one is Amex.), and the amount was exactly the amount of these two flight booking.I called the help centre and discussed more than 4 times, (every time i had to wait for 30min to reach staff) and almost everytime ""Escalation team will contact you within 48 hours"". Yes, they called me later, but their saying was  ""our team is still seeking solution and contact you in 72hr"". However, no call was coming after 72h. So i made another call, but the same process was repeated again and again. USELESS.Finally, on 20 Nov, Expedia staff called me and showed me one poor solution. As they cannot cancel the flight, they wanted me to do no-show or use the flight!!!! What their saying was, if I would do no-show, Germanwing will back money partially, then, Expeidia will cover the rest amount. I accepted that offer and decided to use one of flight bookings as I didnt want to be bothered anymore by them. Then, I used one of my bookings to fly over to Germany in early Dec. After I came back from the trip, having Expedia said, Germanwing refunded about half amount of payment in mid Dec. So I sent a mail to  Expedia on 23 Dec to ask compensation for remaining amount. They responded immediately and said that refund was to be made soon, but in fact, not yet.I contacted again on 15th Jan, and I received a call Expedia on 17 and promised me to update what the issue is, but no call was coming up.Very poor system and useless customer service when trouble happens. I will never use again.[Updated on 5 Feb 2017]Immediately after I posted my review here, Expedia contacted me by phone several times (one of the calls was ridiculously coming at 5am in UK time) and left the message on voicemail. The guy excused that their side tried to remit the money, however, my card was something wrong which card detail number ended XXXX, which i have no idea about. Great, I carefully double checked every card details and noticed that the card detail they have was the previous debit card which i registered to expedia.co.uk in the last year, but closed in 6 months ago. What they originally said (actually demanded) was they were going to  refund the money to my AMEX card which used for the payment, but suddenly, without any notice to me, Expedia tried to refund the money to my debit card, which is registered and was not used for this payment.I logged in to Expedia and changed my card detail on their site, and send a mail to support centre to refund the money to the newly registered card ASAP.One day later, I received a mail that they transferred the money.Three days later, I FINALLY confined that I got my money back!!!! What i learned and recommend you all were;Firstly, try to avoid using Expedia - there are plenty of alternative travel sites. You don't have to stick with them. Secondary, if you are unfortunately in trouble with them, contact with them by email and get a ""Ref number"", which enables that you can relatively talk easily with them by this number - you may be able to avoid explaining your situation to them again and again. Tertiary, try to record every conversation/communication as much as possible. If possible contact with them by email. If some offer was given from them, request them to send that in writing by mail.Finally, do contact and push them by whatever method - calling, sending a mail again and again, also, writing a review here like me - they may immediately respond to you as the review is exposed in public.Hope those will help to all who is unfortunately in trouble with them in the future."

168,"Hi Robert, we're sorry if you feel this way. We have discussed this matter with the hotel and also tried to advocate on your behalf.

Totally disgusted!
","I can now confirm, after receiving the Expedia 'experience', that they are indeed very bad!!I made a booking, paid in full and my 'confirmed' reservation was cancelled! Not only cancelled, but lied to and that's what hurts! Rather than find me another room to replace the wrongly cancelled one, they decided they would try and get me to pay more! When I asked to escalate my issue to a senior manager, my request was denied!No customer care, or at least, very little.BEWARE and look elsewhere.Thanks R - Itinerary 7240460564909The last response is total lies.I had the option of paying immediately, or at the hostel. I paid immediately and received confirmation with the payment details and was advised I had to pay ?4 tax once we booked into the hostel. I had my mobile with myself all day and no missed calls are showing (or voicemail messages) and no missed calls from my home phone either and no messages left. Yet another lie.The only contact was via a cancellation email. If Expedia are customer focused, I'd suggest you retrace your investigations, arrive at the facts and offer recompense for this shambles! Until then, you are a disgrace.Facts-Price summaryPrice breakdownRoom price ?89.003 nights: ?29.67 avg./night17/2/2017 ?31.0018/2/2017 ?31.0019/2/2017 ?27.00Taxes : included Deposit processed:?89.00 (?75.86)Balance due at hotel:?0.00 (?0.00) Total ?89.00 (?75.86)Yes, as expected.

169,"Hi Steve, we apologise for the issues you faced in terms of voucher use and the cancellation policies.

If an airline or a hotel has set some restrictions on a booking then we always work around those policies. Please know that we can?t amend or override those policies in any shape or form. Our website only says that we as Expedia do not charge the fees. However, the respective airline or the hotel will as it depend on the fare type you had booked i.e. refundable or non-refundable.

First and last time for me with Expedia
","In September 2016 I rented a car at Malaga Airport, Spain for three weeks through Expedia. The amount I paid was to include full insurance. However, when collecting the car the rental agency would not release the vehicle unless I paid additional insurance. I insisted that I didn't need further insurance (in addition to that purchased with the Expedia booking I have an annual policy for rented cars to cover any eventuality) but the car rental company would not let me take the vehicle unless I paid an extra ?150. On arrival at my Spanish holiday destination I went online and contacted Expedia to explain what had happened. I followed this up on my return home to the U.K. and Expedia called me to offer a refund in the form of ?100 cash plus a ?50 credit to my Expedia account to be used on any future travel plan (hotel, flight etc.). I accepted the offer. In January 2017 I planned to visit relatives and used the credit in part payment to book a hotel through Expedia. However, a few days later there was a change of plan from the family members I was visiting which meant that I would need to cancel and re-book for a different date. I checked the Expedia website to see if there would be any penalty for cancelling and I read the following...'Need to amend a hotel booking? If your plans should change, remember we do not charge any change or cancel fees.'Thus assured that there would be no penalty I cancelled the hotel booking expecting the ?50 to be re-credited to my Expedia account. Not so. When the credit did not reappear in my Expedia account I contacted them. Expedia e-mailed to advise that under their terms and conditions they do not give refunds on 'used' vouchers. A plethora of e-mails then began between us as I tried in vain to explain that it wasn't a voucher, it was a credit and furthermore it hadn't been used. There then followed a couple of phone calls from Expedia where the operatives merely repeated over and over that they don't refund vouchers. The last such call from Expedia was on 22nd January 2017. When I said that I intended to warn potential Expedia customers about them not honouring the wording of their policy on cancellations. This time the operative told me that his supervisor would consider my case and contact me within 5 days. That was 8 days ago. Have I been contacted? No. Not a single word from Expedia other than when I just e-mailed them to advise that I intended to make other potential customers aware of their shortcomings. They e-mailed an automatic response to me which reads..' Need to amend a hotel booking? If your plans should change, remember we do not charge any change or cancel fees. Really? Could've fooled me.If anyone at Expedia wishes to check the validity of this review my case no is - Case ID : [REQ:M-16008725]"

Terrible customer service
",First time user of expedia booking a flight. The booking appeared on my phone app but constantly said that the tickets were not confirmed and it would update in 24hrs. It said this for 3 weeks. Called expedia who confirmed that the flights were ok. I then went back on the app and the flight had disappeared. Checked online and they had been cancelled !!!!. Called expedia who confirmed that the person I spoke to had cancelled the flights and they could not offer any explanation. I am now in the 72hrs waiting period and from the performance of their staff I'm not convinced it will be straight forward. Good job I checked as I would have been stranded in a different country.

Trouble with Expedia Continues
","Update 30th JanuaryI hear nothing from Expedia even though they post a comment on my review asking for my itinerary number, yet I still hear nothing regarding my claim.  However I did receive an email from Airhelp today via Expedia who's form submission couldn't be less transparent if it tried.  They ask for all the details of your claim but DO NOT TELL l you that they take a commission on the compensation until you see the charge at the very end of the form.  Oh and sorry, there is a click down called 'Price List', but again it is not clear from the outset that you are dealing with a third party.  I thought that the email was from expedia (which it was) and that I was dealing with their internal department not a 3rd party.Outrageous - am continually disappointed at Expedia's handling of this issue.  Note to self - do not use expedia again and be wary of AirHelp.Original ReviewBe careful when booking flights on Expedia.  If your flight is cancelled as ours was due to fog at the inbound airport, it will be a difficult and time consuming process to seek your compensation.  I called expedia on the day for help, and no help in finding alternative flights was offered.  I then called to get my compensation and the issue was elevated to the customer relations team who did not email or log my enquiry so you are left to chase.  This process has so far taken 25 days and I am on 'hold' 25 minutes with the service team who are trying to find an update.  Meanwhile I am out of pocket to the tune of ?2500 given the cost of the cancelled flights and the new flights I had to purchase.  I will never use Expedia again.Itinerary #7223894084434.  I have also emailed the customer service complaints team and been given a reference of REQ:M-16076174, advising me I may need to wait for another 10 days before they can process my request/concerns.  How does expedia expect people to go into debt and pay interest on a credit card whilst they languish over a very straightforward issue."

AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL
","Last night I went to book a last minute hotel in London and found Expedia's 'Secret Savers' ""Deal"". They quoted that the deal would give a great rate (40% off) top branded hotels. I chose a 3* hotel in East London and awaited the email to confirm the hotel. What a disappointment! The hotel is called City Inn Express in Hackney. It's an independent hotel with a 2* rating. It's average review on most websites is 1/5 and it very clearly is a health and safety nightmare considering people's photos of the place. Not good. Upon further investigation, I have now discovered that the hotel I paid ?162.97 for three nights stay is actually ?158 on Expedia to book without this supposed deal! I've contacted Expedia through Facebook messages and spoken to a robot who says I can't have a refund and I can't swap my booking to another hotel either. They generously gave me the ?4.97 difference in form of a refund and now won't reply to me. Absolutely appalling service and a disgusting ploy to con people into booking crappy hotels that they can't get bookings for. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!"

Unprofessional and a scam
","Booked a flight with Expedia. Worst mistake of course. 10 hours before the flight noticed it wasn't confirmed so called them up. Apparently made it to the wrong department so the customer care person had to write an email to the correct department and said I would def receive a phone call within the hour. Ofcourse nothing happens, now 4 hours left to the flight and I can still the see the tickets are not confirmed.Called again, this time the person kept saying don't worry let me sort this out for you and what does he do, cancels my booking and happily says don't worry we won't charge your account. My Grandmother had a heartattack  and I wanted to be with her but he is happy that the account didn't get charged. Resolution book again through expedia for the same flight in 4 hours. The first time he is not sure what happened.Final nail in the coffin, of course the account got charged. It's reduced my cleared balance.

Horrible Customer Service and a Fraud Company
","I booked a ticket through Expedia for a Jetblue flight. I noticed that there was a mispelling in my name and checked JetBlues website. It was mentioned that this can be rectified at no extra cost if I contact my travel agent. I contacted Expedia and they mentioned that they can change this and kept me on hold. They passed me on to another agent who after keeping me on hold for an hour says that she is trying to understand what I need to change in my ticket. After keeping me on hold for another hour, she said that she tried to correct the mispelling but for some reason Jetblues website is not showing the updated name. She told me to go to the airport and figure it myself. I asked her if she can provide an email interaction of this so that I can contact JetBlue or show it at the airport as I would need some proof that Expedia tried to correct the issue. She wasn't willing to transfer the call to a supervisor, give me an email interaction or even mention her full name (only mentioned that it was Juliet T). She kept me on hold for two hours and was very rude. She said that I booked the ticket from Jetblue, and Expedia didn't take money from the ticket so it is Jetblue who will fix this.This was the worst customer experience. I would never book a ticket from Expedia. If Expedia is not willing to take responsibility, then it should shut down, It cannot ask a customer to figure it on their own when it is something they are supposed to fix as per the airline's policy. Is Expedia not making money from its customers. Why does Expedia consistently keeps its customers on hold for an hour, 2 hours and sometimes more than that. Has Expedia's management and CEO ever tried to Google 'issues with Expedia', 'how to escalate issue with Expedia'. It will tell them the kind of harassment that Expedia puts its customers through."

Funds taken from my account without authorisation
","Everyone BEWARE - Do not book through EXPEDIA. I tried to book a weekend break for 4 Adults- a total of over ?1300.00. My card was declined twice (which was strange cause I knew I had the money in my account) telephoned my card provider to be told that Expedia had taken ?753.28 out of my account. I called Expedia and they could give me no information or explanation on why this money had been taken. So I'm ?753.28 short in my bank and NO booking has been confirmed.researched Expedia on line and this is not an isolated incident. Expedia have done this to many other customers, and it is extremely difficult to get them to refund the money - some people waiting longer than 16 weeks - one guy has still not been refunded after 12 months and is taking court action ...Luckily, as I called my card provider last night, I have managed to put a stop on the amount and it is back in my account this morning.UPDATE - Expedia has responded to this complaint (see below). I will Not be emailing them. As far as I am concerned Expedia are aware of the 'glitch' in there system and have done nothing to stop the problem reoccurring with other Customers.

Absolutely horrendous
","I personally wouldn't give this website or the customer service 1 star.

This meant we had flights booked but no where to stay! We called and waited 40 minutes for our call to be answered for then to be passed from pillar to post because no one wanted to deal with our query. We have now completely lost trust in company, due to the lack of customer service skills and the unreliable website. I advise people NOT TO BOOK A HOLIDAY with this company as it may also happen to you."

Misleading advertising
","Last time I use the Expedia website, their advertising and statements in bold are so misleading.  On pre-booking a hotel, the statements made by Expedia in BOLD (I.e. Free cancellation and reserve now and pay later) were found to be totally false when seconds after the booking my account was charged with the full payment. Read the fine print, because their BOLD statements are factually incorrect. So unprofessional to........My itinerary number is (Itinerary #7237725948013), which I subsequently cancelled and actually incurred a cost of GBP75 due to the exchange rate differences. Your site provides bold reference to reserve now and pay later claims that are not factually correct! I find this whole experience quite disappointing and expensive for no benefit gained!"

Car hire frustration
","I booked a car through Expedia for a ski holiday from 7th to 28th January 2017. Knowing Alpine conditions. Chose Expedia because of their ""Winter fees included"" promise which is still being shown on their website. On arrival at Chambery airport I was very surprised to be asked if I wanted to pay for snow chains. The Hertz/ Thrifty desk had no documentation from Expedia that winter fees were included. Whilst there is rang the Expedia help number who confirmed there was no record of ""Winter fees included"". I rechecked the Expedia site which still claims ""Winter fees included"".I am now in the with lots of snow and no winter tyres to get me out. Despite a second call to Expedia on 7th January promising a reply within 48 hours I have received nothing. ( today is 13th)I have emailed Expedia.co.uk three times but no response. I feel I have been misled by Expedia's advertising and it seems they no longer care about my plight as they have taken my payment.Disgraceful conduct which leaves coustomers in a very precarious predicament having to take cars unfit for purpose.My itinerary number is: 7214162888137.Thanks for the reply. However, I was promised a reply within 48 hrs last Saturday! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

Never Again - Lost my Custom
","I booked flight to Key West last month to visit a family member who has just completed cancer treatment. The booking went through no issues, only email I received was to advice a change of time departing Atlanta so didn't recheck on Expedia until yesterday when I went to print out my itinerary. Shocked to discover two flights of my return leg had been cancelled! Straight on the phone to Expedia only to spend best parts of 40 minutes being put on hold only to be told I needed to be transferred. So I was then transferred over to another advisor who seemed to know what he was doing and reassured me that he would sort it but had to check with another department to make sure he was allowed to . On hold again. Advisor comes back and explains not to worry he was rebooking returning flights and I would not be charged anymore as it was their error. Promised me a call back which I never got. Logged back on to Expedia and looked like he had stuck to his word.Later last night received another email from Expedia saying the two flights had been cancelled and if I didn't request it call them. Back on the phone to another advisor who said issue was being escalated not to worry it would be sorted. Had to believe him.Logged on to Expedia this morning to discover whole trip had been cancelled. Back on the phone AGAIN, the advisor did not have a clue what he was doing, said I had requested changes and my credit card charged ?163. What!!! Stress levels now through the roof, I am meant to fly on Saturday. I asked to speak to Supervisor which didn't happen but another advisor came back on saying he needed to talk to another department again. Back on hold. Finally came back saying it was an advisor error and a new flight had been booked and he would email me the tickets.My real worry is if I had not been the one checking and calling all the time I would have turned up at the Airport on Saturday having no flight.I had booked extra leg room and exit row seats direct with Virgin and have had to call and email them to get these transferred over to the new flight.I have used Expedia for years and recommended them to friends and family, I am sorry but I have now lost all faith in the company.For the Expedia person that monitors these reviews my original itinerary number was 7228952925747, please can you note my comments and escalate."
188,"H Parsa, I'm very sorry to hear about your recent experience. Apologies for the problems you have faced while booking with Expedia. Rest assured, we take your issue very seriously.

daylight Robbery!!!
","well, on the 1st of January 2017 I booked a ticket through Expedia.co.uk which after the payment showed on my browser the ticket it is in processing which took more than 7 hours to say that the ticket it is no longer available. I was on the phone to customer service begging for this ticket more than 7 hours using my phone from Mexico which I ended up having a bill of ?229. at the end one of the stuff said why not buy your ticket from Air Europa directly, which I did and took me 2 min to get the ticket. In fact on the 8th January I checked my credit card statement I was so shocked Expedia charged me for the ticket that never was sold to me!!!!!! At this point I have made a complain to my credit card compony to try and return the money back to my account. I would never ever in a million year would refer this website to any one. I have 0 tolerant for this compony."

Not passing on hotel refund legally due for over a year
","My family and I stayed at the Waldorf Astoria in Dubai between 28/12/15 and 02/01/16. Due to poor service on the part of the Waldorf, they refunded a sum of ?1,623.63 (as confirmed by Expedia) in respect of our stay at their hotel. They maintain that they refunded Expedia on 02/01/16. We have repeatedly tried to collect this refund through calls with Expedia, and have repeatedly been given promises about repayment that were not delivered upon. For example, we had a call with a man at Expedia called Devesh on 06/05/16 where he promised that the refund would be made in full within 24 hours and email confirmation would follow; it never arrived. He also promised that the manager would call me to take my credit card details to process the payment and discuss compensation for the time it had taken for the refund to be processed, and the time involved in repeatedly calling Expedia to try and generate the refund. The latest person we spoke to was a lady called Syshmitha, who provided the BFSCRD email address (for the first time). So, Expedia - please don't bother replying with this suggestion. The reply we received stated that the amount we should be refunded should be a lower amount and said that our credit card had been stolen in which case we would need to provide details of a new credit card with bank evidence. This was the latest delay tactic, as our card had never been stolen and they had the details on file all the time. We should be refunded the amount we are legally due as stated above and provided with some compensation for the time and stress we have had to endure to recover the amount.Reference number is 19862063911"

WORST COMPANY EXPERIENCE EVER
","Dear Faceless Expedia Person,As I as previously advised you when you sent me my flights booking for India, ( Dublin - LHR-Delhi. Delhi-Gatwick- Dublin) and I paid for in good faith, we had little chance of making  our return connection flight to Dublin as you had , in your wisdom, booked me and my wife and young family on a flight from Gatwick airport at 21.00, with my incoming flight to London from Delhi due into London Heathrow at 18.00. Even if the Delhi flight had arrived on schedule, it was never realistic, to actually collect  our four bags off the belt, then proceed through customs, catch a taxi to Gatwick , which is approximately 38 miles away, at the height of rush hour traffic in the greater London area, and try and make check-in for Dublin. This also had a cost factor of approximately ?100, I had enquired about this potential particular scenario with people ie taxi drivers and airport personnel in Heathrow , who would have a better knowledge than the very ignorant and aggressive person that eventually left a message on my phone, all the way from some location in the United States, saying my fears were unfounded and Expedia weren't for turning. They , without exception agreed that the Expedia proposed connection flight from Gatwick was utterly ludicrous, especially when a flight to Dublin was available from Heathrow at 20.45. To add insult to an outrageous booking, Expedia wanted me to pay ?700 to transfer their clearly mistaken Gatwick connection back to Heathrow. The London Heathrow to Dublin  flight  at 20.45, was ?252.00 in total for the four of us which we booked as back up.As it turned out our flight from Delhi arrived into London Heathrow , two hours late. No chance of making Gatwick. Though we were very much discommoded , Virgin Airways, had us booked into a hotel for the night, but Aer Lingus staff, who are so professional and customer friendly, and were unable to comprehend the rationale of the original Expedia's flight package we were sold, transferred our flights to Heathrow from Gatwick and ensured we were well catered for. In addition, they have offered to refund our back up flight.We also booked a ""Four Star Hotel "" in Calangute, Goa, India, called Ocean Palms Hotel. Paid ?2396, for a family room , non refundable up front payment, in good faith for eight nights. Turned out to be a dump, down a side street. The room was tiny and not fit for purpose. The photographs on Expedia were very misleading. After a robust meeting with the management of the hotel I managed to secure a second room just for space. The buffet for breakfast was very limited. We paid less per night in Delhi for two stunning rooms in Le Meridien which I happened to booked separately. We are very angry and frustrated about this rip off and no real person from Expedia , apart from an initial , to discuss this with. Complete robotic and an absolute disgrace.In essence, Expedia are the worst travel agency , I have ever had to deal with. You were aggressive, insulting, customer unfriendly,  very poorly briefed and I will never use your services again, while also advising both family, friends and colleagues of your extremely poor service.Joseph Peter Daly"

Expedia Price Guarantee Scam - do not trust!
","I booked a holiday on 7/1/17. The price leading to the booking was fluctuating hugely but when it was rising I booked in confidence, with the Best Price Guarantee in mind. Within 24 hours the identical booking was discounted, with a reduction in price of ?474.39. I immediately submitted a claim for the Best Price Guarantee (ref M-15924812). This was rejected as I had included hotel transfers with my booking!The lower quote used in the claim included identical itineries, as specified with the policy, with the same transfer fee and conditions. I have repeatedly been told to check the policy - which has no mention of claims being void if extras such as insurance/transfer fees are added. Incidentally, the insurance is added by default and needed to be clicked off when booking. It is probably common for others to add these extras without being aware of this price guarantee claim not being adhered to. I am a regular loyal customer and hugely disappointed with the service and customer service. Do not trust this guarantee or Expedia  - in the future I will be shopping around!"

Abysmal Customer Service
","I had an absolutely awful experience with Expedia where they essentially scammed $180 of my money and provided absolutely no services.  They verbally promised to repay, twice.  And then they emailed that they would not, and several weeks later have simply stopped replying to emails.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.  Awful customer services.   Here are my issues with what occurred:-          I rented a car through Expedia and Europecar-          Prior to arriving to collect the rental car, I called Europecar to confirm the car category 'VW Golf or similar' who said that there were no VW Golfs in this range ever available in this category, and in order to obtain a golf or similar I would have to pay an extra ?15 a day.  To advertise a car category in which the car does not exist is misleading advertising at best on the part of Expedia.-          When I arrived in person to collect my rental car I was informed that 'at the manager's discretion, I was to be charged an extra ?1000 deposit as I was a British citizen residing in the USA'.  This was not detailed within the terms of the rental, and has never happened to me before when I have used Expedia for previous car hires with Avis.  As this was a refundable deposit, I continued with the rental, accepting this ridiculous charge.-          I was then informed that despite having full auto rental insurance coverage through my credit card I would not be able to rent the car unless I took out Europecar's own insurance at an additional cost of ?25 per day.  Again, this was not detailed anywhere in the rental agreement, and has never happened in prior rentals through Expedia before.  At this point I suspected that the sales representative was attempting to overcharge for services.-          The total amended bill was then produced, at a shocking ?200 extra, plus a ?1000 deposit.  Given that I paid $178 for the car, this made absolutely no sense.  I then said that I was going to cancel the booking and the Europecar representative agreed that this was the best course of action, and added notes to the file to detail why my status as a British citizen living in America disqualified me from being able to rent from them as I still carried a UK driver's license but US credit card.-          The Europecar representative then stopped me when I was about to leave, and said 'let me see if I can cut you a deal outside of Expedia, oh look it's ?278 for the car rental, will we do this instead?'.  This is unprofessional at best, and I can only assume that this entire farce listed above occurred as they are on commission and would rather personally make a sale than have one made through Expedia. This entire situation made me incredibly uncomfortable, given that the sales team had clearly attempted to manipulate charges in order to gain commission themselves.-          With the affirmation of Europecar's representative that everything must be cancelled through Expedia, and all was ok on the end of Europecar I left without a car.-          I returned home 30 minutes later, and called Expedia's customer team.  The woman I talked to spent 45 minutes on the phone to me, and contacted Europecar twice.  On this phone call she confirmed that the refund had been fully processed and would be in my bank account within 5 days.  She was profusely apologetic for the experience which I had just endured.-          I then received an email from Expedia 3 days later.  This was completely unexpected given that the customer representative said that the case was closed, the refund was being processed and would be transferred within 5 days.  I am utterly shocked at Expedia's complete lack of professionalism as this should never occur.  A full two weeks after this first email this sham is still ongoing, with Expedia now refusing to refund on the grounds that Europecar will not refund the monies which they agreed to do when on the phone to Expedia's customer services representative.  I should not be party to any of these issues as Expedia agreed to refund me fully.  If a vendor then backs out of this it should be on Expedia to reclaim, not me.This has been a horrifically bad experience and I will never ever use either of these companies again.  I strongly recommend that others follow suit.Update: the itin # is 7228952935771Update: it's now more than a month since this awful experience and no one from Expedia has responded or contacted me after asking for the itinerary number. I think this very well sums up my Expedia experience. Do not use this company."

No customer service for the second time! May I suggest you leave well alone
",I had a bad experience when I booked a Dubai hotel and Experia did not honour my original booking.Today I booked a York Hotel that was advertised as a 'York City Centre - Train Station - 4 star hotel which would be allocated upon payment at a much cheaper cost. Unfortunately upon payment I was allocated the Novotel which is on the other side of York a good distance from the station and the hotel is cheaper on the expecial site than what I paid! I rang Expedia and was passed onto three different staff before the call was ended whilst I was still hanging on. Worst service EVERMy itinerary #7234023558572We book 'Secret' Hotels regularly with Lastminute.com and will continue to do so because we know that they offer good value for money. Secret Hotels with them are always cheaper than the disclosed hotel would be on their site unlike Expedia who in our case charged us more for the Secret Hotel which was revealed as the Novotel than if we had chosen the Novotel on the Expedia site. I will never book with them again as this is our second bad experience and again Customer Services have not provided any support.In addition the hotel is no where near the Train Station as described

Unhelpful when you need them the most (and unwilling to do their job)
","I had booked an internal flight in Mexico and had given myself plenty of time to get to my destination in order to hook up with some pre-paid and necessary onward travel to get me to the USA.The airline delayed my flight substantially meaning that I was of course going to miss out on my pre-paid plans. I understand that this is of course in no way Expedia's fault - It was the airline who made the flight change. So I contacted them and requested a refund as the change wasn't of my own doing. This was on October 27. Expedia told me they were managing my request and that the refund would be processed within 8 weeks.After numerous attempts to get an update on my refund I received the same old half hearted replies that offered no real insight or update at all. They eventually got back to me yesterday and told me to contact the airline directly, which is really their job. They also implied that i would have to contact them to change my flight to another day, like they had forgotten the reason I requested the airline refund me in the first place.I decided that I would then try and call the airline where i was kept on hold for 15 minutes and then hung up on. So there's goes 15 minutes worth of expensive call credit dialling Mexico international and I guess I can kiss goodbye the cost of me and my sister's flights.Thanks for nothing Expedia.

After many years, bye bye Expedia!  ?
","After many years, bye bye Expedia! Shocking service and pointless customer care department.I have been booking with Expedia for serveral years and generally it has been ok. I just booked a hotel in China for two nights and didn't book the usual brand of hotel I like to stay in because it was far from the metro on the expedia map. So I booked another that would be more convienient to use the metro. Then I happen to check on google because my friend asked what happened about staying at the hotel we planned and she told it's right on the metro!So turns out the Expedia map has an error, every hotel was out of position on the map. The booking was marked cannot be cancelled or refunded, but since the decision was based on their misleading information on the website I thought I would contact them.First one said some technical people had to look and would call me back in 30 mins. Didn't happened. Called again and the next person agreed and understood the problem - she raised this to a higher level to contact me. They contacted me and didn't really understand the issue and they thought it was an address problem. After them again checking for the 3rd time the only reply was that the address is correct and then booking is made so nothing they can do. I explained again their website has mislead me to  book a hotel that I didn't really want to stay in... but they don't care at all, the booking is made and can't be changed. So after many years, good bye. When you treat customers like this you don't derseve loyalty, brand or reputation because you don't understand the customer experience but love to take the customers money time and time again.For the reply - 7232791474857I don't think anyone at Experia is able to listen... after their attempts to look into this they repeat the same thing - the address is the same and correct. Several times I have explained that the address was never a concern or issue it is the map!!!! Do you hear MAP?!?!? The feature on your website that shows the location on a MAP?!?! I don't expect to have to verify the information you provide on your website with a 3rd party application....hence the reason to contact you since the very start!  You may as well send me all the terms and conditions that you are somehow not liable for errors of the information about the hotels (except maybe the address? Since you are so in tune with this potential liability). Then you don't need to bother with any kind of customer service dept or after sales dept...just an automatic reply to tell your customers what your liabilities are as definied in your terms and conditions. Well, conclusion is the same....terrible customer service, poorly presented information on a ""map"" and will no longer book with Expedia. Thanks for all the effort to not listen to me, to check you liabilities and to not to even think for half a second on what the customer experience is... I will have to assume all responsibility when we engage in a transaction and god forbid if you mislead me with an incorrect map that you might be all be responsible in any way shape or form."

How to fall out of love
","I used to love Expedia, I was a big fan and I spent thousands, sometimes tens of thousands with them for business and personal travel. Then in 2015 when I had a problem with trying to cancel a booking I made in error within five minutes of pressing ""OK"" they refused to help despite the hotel confirming there was no charge. Several hundred pounds out of pocket I emailed, wrote, phoned and tried everything to get a response. Nothing. Eventually the lovely people at American Express refunded the money and took up my case with Expedia but I heard nothing. So I stopped using them, I went from a sizeable spender to zero overnight. Did their systems notice? Did they attempt to understand why? No. Nothing. Roll on a few months and my daughter was going to the USA and she found flights on Expedia so I booked them for her. The plane was delayed, she was stranded but there was no communication from Expedia despite the fact that BA said that it was up to the travel agent to keep us informed about what was happening. I vowed never to use Expedia again but yesterday, after practically zero use in 18 months they emailed to say I'd reached ""+gold"" status, their highest level of status and benefits. How fabulous! How many other useless uncaring companies that I don't spend money with are going to give me pointless benefits in return for my non-custom?  Or is it that having insulted me with rubbish service Expedia are now trying to con me into believing they care?Laughable."
204,"Hi Luis, we are sorry for the frustration and your recent experience. We  understand the situation here and to be honest we had no intentions of adding any stress to this.

Terrible Customer Service, will never use again.
","We had a major change to our flight schedule (42hours) which they never bothered to inform us of, when we eventually discovered it by looking at the itinerary on their site and discovering the flights weren't there anymore we rang up the customer service helpline.I was constantly told it would be 48 hours before they got a response from the airline, I called about 6 times over 3 days and was put on hold over and over with the agent saying whatever they can to make me wait another 24 hours.   Each time I rang it was like the first time because the previous agent hadn't put any notes on our case.  When I eventually asked to speak to a supervisor I was put on hold for about 15 minutes before being told they were all busy and that one would call me back, which they never did.Eventually I persuaded an agent to call the airline while I waited on the phone and they came back saying that our only option was to take the later flight and that expedia would not be able to compensate us for the inconvenience and would not refund us for the hotel and safari we would miss because of the change despite the hotel being booked through expedia (albeit by a different member of the group).Eventually I found another route myself and rang up again, managing to get the agent to agree with the airline to let us travel that route instead (4 changes but arrived about 30 mins after our originally scheduled arrival).  They still haven't updated the itinerary on their site after 48 hours of them telling me it would take 24 hours to come through.Basically a useless service that almost lost us 2 days of our holiday, offered little to no assistance and had no protection when things changed, terrible communication and basically lies to you about when they'll contact you.Will never use them again :-("

Call back in an hour
","I called Expedia, from South Korea(not cheap) to change my flight dates. I called five times, the first time I called I was on the phone for about half an hour, mainly on hold while they tried to sort my ticket out. I got cut off. The second time, I said I was speaking to someone a few minutes ago but got cut off, I was on hold again for another 15 minutes while she went to find who it was. I got cut off. The third time, I got a man saying call back in an hour because they had a technical fault. I waited, called back after that and got another man who said he needed to put me on hold.. I got cut off again!! I called back 2 minutes later to.. sorry, call back in an hour we have a technical issue. I give up, they don't seem to know what they are doing and they continously have 'technical issues'. It's really put me off using them in the future, in case I can't even get to speak to someone for longer than 1 minute to sort anything out."

You can't leave zero rating but reaching out to Expedia just leave stop trading your truly a poor booking agent!
",This company cannot and will not solve any problems - once they  have your booking and paid your money they don't care about customer !  . They are off line in a country where you cannot get any resolution through courts so the only way you can share your experience and get this company to account for its poor service and accountability is book with a better booking agent - there are many out there  just check the rating for Expedia on line and you can see their 3rd rate poor performance  - i.e. Book direct with the airline who will communicate with the customer directly and  can be held responsible for their flight bookings.  Don't be fooled by Expedia asking for numbers and references they don't sort anything they blame everyone else for their poor performance - once again they got your money they got you!!

","4 of our party of 6 missed flights because the taxi service provider (CARMEL LIMOS IN NYC) failed to turn up. For an hour after the scheduled time they repeatedly promised a car in the next 5 to 10 minutes only for none to turn up.

Absolutely unacceptable and unethical practicess
","I have contacted Expedia to book a flight for my family of 4 who were stranded with no money and flight in Bangkok. I started my enquiry by advising I am in the UK British national and I would like to book and pay with my debit card for tickets for my family from Bankok to Sofia. The flights are in 10hrs. I asked is there a problem paying for the tickets since I am not one of the passengers and I was advised no no problem. So I paid for everything at 2.30pm however have not received my tickets confirmation by 3.30pm and called them back. After 1 hr on hold I was advised I will be contacted by their ticketing team in 1hr! I received an email confirming that titled ""60-minute contact"". I had no choice but wait 90mins passed and nothing happened, no call!The transaction has been authorised by my bank and the funds put aside to be debited, therefore unavailable to me.I called again and explained I need this tickets confirmed as my family need to organise their travel to the airport for a flight in 10hrs. After diabolical conversation where the agent is behaving like 10 year old and the only think they can say is ""sorry but is not in my authority"" I requested to speak to someone with authority. This person advised me that the tickets have been flagged as they can not be issued as there is a problem with the transaction but they can not tell me what is the problem. Further to that when I asked why I have not received a call as promised earlier I was told usually it takes 3 hours so he does not know why I was advised it will be 1hr! Rediculous!Now I explained I spoke to my bank and there is no problem the funds are available and put aside for you to debit! He would not tell me what is the problem . So I said but now I don't have the money available to me and also no confirmed flights! He said sorry you will get your money back in up to 7 days! I say 7 days I need my money now to pay for tickets for a flight in 10hrs not in 7 days!I now have no funds and no flight! Nobody called even after 3 hrs! Somebody needs to do something about this company. This company should not be permitted to trade and I will be taking this to trading standards and the regulator."

Shocking customer service - absolutely no help if you have a problem.
","I made a booking for a work colleague to stay in a hotel in Holland for 3 nights.. The hotel claimed to have received the booking twice and charged me twice.

I have called Expedia customer services 3 times, including numerous emails and I am not getting anywhere. On my last call to a ""Manager"" I was told to wait another 28 days for a response. It is now day 33, needless to say I never received a call back and I am approximately ?90 out of pocket, through no fault of my own. I will not use Expedia for any more of my corporate (or personal) hotel bookings.ITINERARY NUMBER: 7207941256820.Thank you, but how much longer am I expected to wait?

Worst experience of my life
","It is a cooperation that only cares about making money and has put customer care on the back burner. They are unprofessional and inconsistent with their service; where I had an issue with them over a payment taken from a hotel and it took them over one month to send me a reply and in the end they made the choice of gaining a commission rather than gaining a customer, even if they were clearly at fault. Thank god we've reached the point were there are many other better companies, that care about their customers, to choose from. Will never be using their services ever again!It's 112252651472, I understand that I have a 48-hour window where I should have cancelled the reservation before the upcoming date of reservation. However, I made the reservation on June 10 for the end of July and never received any follow-up e-mails in that month and a half period so naturally I assumed that there's no reservation for me to alter."

","Itinerary 7216703658700Tried booking a weekend return flight to Madrid for my son and myself, but unable to do so. Telephoned Expedia direct who also couldn't book it and after being on the phone for a long time was informed it was not working due to going and coming home on different airlines, so could we do two separate transactions . No problem there agent booked a flight out with Ryan Air 17/02/2017 and returning 20/02/2017 with Brussels Air, happy days or so I thought. I was checking my emails a couple of weeks ago and noticed the return flight was booked for 20/03/2017 a whole month later so I phoned and explained they had made a mistake and could they change it, but was told I needed to rebook a return flight and pay again and they would refund me, so they booked and I payed for correct flight home on the 20/02/2017. I was promised someone would be in touch within 72 hours and this was ten days ago and after multiple emails and direct phone calls I still have not received a call or being refunded, just promises and lies . I am still waiting Expedia and expect to be refunded. Gary CookAn hour after I posted this review I received a phone call from 'Ravi' who was very helpful and told me I would be getting refunded. He stated that I would receive an email with ?107 return credit and within five to ten days would be credited but take no notice of ?107 email as I am owed ?242. (Strange).Today my credit card has had ?107 returned to it, if Expedia think I am going to accept this they are mistaken I want a full refund for their mistake.I will wait another few days just in case more money is credited to my account, so far I am ?135 out of pocket, if anything I should be compensated for all the grief I have had. I am beginning to think Expedia are charging their own employees for their mistakes as some companies do. I will be writing a review every week from today until I am fully refunded and keep the readers updated.Gary Cook. 02/12/201603/12/2016All money now refunded sorry if I doubted you Ravi but it seemed a strange way to refund me, thank you very much Ravi for helping me , you have restored my faith with Expedia."

Absolutely appaling company
","I booked a holiday to Paris with a friend in September for February travel. I booked hotel and flights through Expedia. I got notified at the end of November that my flights had been cancelled and there was no other flights available, yet on their website I could see EasyJet flights on offer. They would not return our money for up to 12 weeks (3 months!!) therefore leaving us unable to book another holiday. We also asked if we could rebook our flights and keep our accommodation however told this could not happen as we bought it as a package (even though they now couldn't offer us any flights?!?). The weekend we were travelling was Rugby weekend and Valentines weekend so the flights and accommodations had rocketed in price by December. We are now left with no holiday and will not get our money back until the end of February. I am absolutely appalled that Expedia wiped their hands of this and blamed the airline Iberia."

Liars and zero customer service!
",Unbelievably bad service.  After 3 or more hour long telephone calls with them they failed to book my flight and then told me to phone the airline direct and they would honour the original price.  Obviously that proved to be incorrect as anyone who has ever booked a flight could tell you.  Expedia offered no form of help or compensation as the flights were now over double the price and would not even take responsibility for the wrong information given to me my one of their staff and his manager.  I will never book with them again and have advised all my contacts of the atrocious service I received.

If you are using a mobile device or smaller width browser (I often use mine ""half-screen"" so I can have two side-by-side) then this information is conveniently ""hidden"" that actually has to be clicked to be seen. Whilst I can see why this might be done for website design experience, it seems a bit sneaky and inconvenient for customer's to see straight away, this kind of thing should be displayed quite prominently so the customer is well aware at the time of booking.

Anyhow I then raised my complaint on social media which soon generated a response from the social media team. I spoke to a member of this team who advised me that there was no way anything could be amended (despite the trip being a year away.)

I understand that there may be some charge to do this. However, I haven't even got to the point (despite multiple emails over several weeks) where we discuss flight changes because Expedia refuse to help me. They insist I call. I have tried to explain multiple times that I have a severe speech impediment thay makes telephone conversations extremely difficult, practically impossible. They have consostanly ignored this and continued to insist I call. So I asked to be put into contact with a manage?. They have refused and are now telling me to get a family member to call. They have said this twice so it's not just a random individual making a mistake. All because I have a speech disability, they are treating me like I'm being a difficult child, and thus need a sensible adult to sort this out for me. Well I am not a being a difficult child, Expedia are acting in a grotesque manner. I am fully able to deal with my own affairs, just not over the phone. Legally, organisations operating in the UK are obliged to make reasonable adjustments. I am physically unable to call but they refuse to help. I wonder if Expedia likewise refuses to help deaf and hard of hearing? If you oppose discrimination, please do not book with Expedia."

Shocking !!!
","I am literally only selecting one star because there is no option to leave zero. I tried booking a trip yesterday but could not go through online, when I rang the call centre I was advised that this was a problem with the system and was told to try again later. So I did, and then there was a problem with their card payment service. We went on to try 3 other cards but got the same message. This morning we went to book this again, but could not book. We then went shopping today and had our cards declined, when we checked our accounts, we found that all FOUR cards had been marked with the full amount!!!!!! This was totally embarrassing and presented some real inconvenience as you can imagine. We then rang the call centre and got through to someone who was so unhelpful and without even an explanation just told us to deal with it through the bank. We were really frustrated but still just wanted to get something booked so tried going through him on the phone to get it sorted but he was offering a much higher price and would not include a voucher which had been valid for us online. After realising there was literally nothing he was willing to do, we ended the call and are now sat on hold trying to resolve the situation with our bank - only three more to go after this! Complete Joke!!UPDATE: They have actually made 6 attempts on one card and have taken ?465 from my card and I have not booked anything - being passed from pillar to post and don't even have a trip planned anymore. FuriousREPLY: That's not good enough - I now have 5 days without being able to spend any money and literally just want to get my trip booked with you - do you not want any business? Don't understand how you operate. The issue is not just with the money - it's the complete lack of customer service"

Trying to book Holiday, Do not use expedia.co.uk again!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","I have to say I will never again use this company, Tried to book holiday online today, web site would not process my payment, had several goes.  Decided to call number on the web site, went through process again. The sales guy went to book  but had problems, he said at one stage part payment had gone through but not all, after 20 minutes he passed me on to customer services. Did not hand over properly, went through whole process again. This person said my bank was not letting this through. Gave me a reference to call back on. Called bank they said there was no problems on their end it?s was the merchant end.Rang expedia.co.uk again, gave the ref number, they could not find my request, gave my email took another 20 minutes final found my request, went through the whole process again.  The priced had by now up by ?600, I said I was given the lower price.   They started making excuses.  Said I wanted to speak to the manager believe it or not that took a long time finally an English person answered the call.  Explained what had happened,   said sorry but there was nothing he could do, if the booking is not made, its not confirmed.  Made excuse we are travel agent not the airlines or hotel. At this point thought why I am wasting my time with this lot.  So will never again use expedia.co.uk again and never call them. The lack understand or language skills.Do not use expedia.co.uk again!!!!!!!!!!!!! even a 1 staring rating is too much for this lot."

Expedia Poor customer service
","Sadly I was naive to think that a large corporation like Expedia could be trusted with my booking and what they subsequently advised me when I called to book a trip to Italy and then again to find out why I had not received any confirmation. I did not receive any email confirmation of my booking which I made with an Expedia agent via telephone. I called Expedia back to find out why I had not received any booking confirmation and was told categorically that the booking and payment had not ""gone through"" and that no payment would be taken. I decided to give up trying to make the booking. I checked my credit card statement at the time and no payment was taken and so concluded as advised no booking existed. Four months later I find that the money was taken from my credit card subsequent to my call which I did not notice as I believed the matter resolved. Having made 3 calls to customer services I have been advised that they sent an email to an incorrect email address and despite my 3 recent calls continued to send emails incorrectly.  I have spent hours already chasing Expedia customer services to refund monies for a trip they completely cocked up the booking for, told me did not exist when I tried to verify details, which even the on-line itinerary checker can't trace. I am still awaiting a resolution to my complaint and money back. Shocking experience and worst in over 30 years of travel. Needless to say a company I will steer clear of in future!                                                                                                                                                                     UPDATE: Itinerary no: 112182925849; which your representative apparently couldn't trace when I called to see whether the booking actually existed at the time of booking and was told it did not. I only obtained this ref on subsequent review and trace of the payment taken from credit card when checking again in Oct when I should have been flying out to Italy and had been contacted to see what time I would be checking into my accommodation.  How they managed to get my email address correct has still not been explained to me despite me sending an email request.                                                                  Complaint refS130775985 which has been 'escalated' although I have now heard this 3 times when you could not even get my email address correct to send me a response to my complaint, which when I did eventually receive it was utter nonsense. I look forward to a speedy resolution to this matter and a full refund."

Terrible customer service - Please avoid EXPEDIA.CO.UK
","*Itinerary # 113062747445*    ALL Sorted later on by Rohan. ThanksWorst customer services I have come across in my life. I booked my holiday to Alicante, Spain for 23rd September, but due to bereavement in family, I had to cancel my holidays. As the flight was low budget one, I called them directly to cancel it, and they refunded my money within a week.BUT EXPEDIA.CO.UK, I am still chasing them but no money in my account, at one time they even said sorry they wont refund me any money as one of their agent didn't fill any notes about my call to cancel the hotel, WOW, I can't beilive a global company can be so irresponsible. Then I did receive an email which states refund has processed and will be in my account in next 5-7 days this was on 10th October(today is 4 November), but when I couldnt see any money in my credit card account after 10 days, I called them and I was shocked with the response(s) I got from them, one of them said sorry you can't get any refund I shouted on him and asked to pass me to superior member of his team, finally I was through to someone who told me your refund is still in pending status as something gone wrong with the process...oh GOD not again, he took my credit card detail again and assured me that it'll get processed and will be in my account in 5-7 days. Ok, time/days/weeks flies....and now its 1st November, called them AGAIN, and same story my refund was again didn't go through, God knows WHY.....as Expedia customer services dont know, I am on my saturation point where I can't even shout on them even.....they took my card detail again and told me will be processed in 5-7 days.I noticed this money(?750) I paid by Credit Card, which do have a big interest rates,  and I am sure my credit card statement will have big interest for me to pay. I am not sure who to blame EXPEDIA or myself, as I should have read their reviews."

Interesting response from Expedia to my review
","Expedia responded to review below suggesting I email their post travel complaints team.  This is the very team that have refused  to look at my case again and keep mentioning 'Air carriers reserve the right to change the flight schedule' which is completely irrelevant to the problem we had. I feel that the reply has been posted on here to give the impression that they are helpful when they are not.Original review:  I am amazed how many reviewers have spoken to a customer service representative.  I recently had an awful experience and could not get any help: I booked flights and hotel through Expedia and was issued with e -tickets which had a statement across the top ""your reservation is booked and confirmed. There is no need to call us to reconfirmed this reservation"". We arrived at airport for first flight of a 3 leg journey and were turned away as apparently the booking hadn't been completed with the airline and they had received no payment (we had paid in full via Expedia website several months before trip). Flight was full and we were offered no help other then being told it was up to our travel agent to deal with this.  In a totally distressed state, I phoned Expedia, the only relevant option when I reached the ""Press 1 for"" menu just led to the etickets and itinerary being emailed to me.  There did not appear to be any option to speak to a real person.  I googled Expedia emergency contact etc... and found several different phone numbers but each one led to the same menu of options.  There was no ""hold for an operator"" or any ""help"" option.  We went back to check in desk to explain our predicament and all they could suggest was that we made the 240 mile drive to the next airport on our itinerary and see if we could get on a flight.  During this drive I continued to try and find a way of speaking to someone at Expedia to no avail.  I sent a message through  their 'contact us' page stating ""Emergency- please phone me"" but just got standard response that I would get a reply within 48 hours.  At the next airport, they could also offer no help and could not provide us with an alternative contact no. for Expedia.  Eventually, after 6 and a half hours, we found someone at the airline who took pity and helped us and rebooked our flights but she could also not give give us a contact no. for Expedia. We eventually got to our destination 26 hours after setting off, we had a night in an airport rather than our luxury hotel. On return home, feeling less stressed, I attempted to contact Expedia again and it suddenly became obvious that if I pressed option to ""make a new booking"" there would be someone glad to take my money - I tried this option and after 2 hours of messing around eventually got to speak to someone in the right department.  I was refunded the one night hotel cost but no refund for flights we were not allowed on or additional costs of 480 mile round trip, parking, etc.  The excuse given: ""we were not contacted to help you make alternative travel plans""!!!!!  They passed buck to the airline who have also denied responsibility. Expedia have now washed their hands of us and will not look at our case again. I hoped they would at least help us, as booking agent, to recover costs from whoever is responsible. 4 weeks after our carefully planned holiday which was a disaster thanks to the booking error, we are still feeling stressed, are well out of pocket financially and now have to go down route of ombudsman to try and get our costs recovered. Absolutely disgusted, I would have left a no star review but seems you have to give a minimum of 1 star to write a review."

Expedia Town Car Abandoned us in New York - traumatised!!
",Don't book SF Best Limousines through Expedia.  They cannot be trusted.I paid Expedia ?157 for a town car to collect me and my family from JFK to our hotel in New York.  The car was 90 minutes late picking us up at JFK.  It wasn't a town car.  It was a friend of the driver who couldn't make it.  We were stood in the freezing windy weather waiting.  We made numerous calls and eventually a Chinese man appeared in a dirty scruffy car saying his friend had called him to pick us up!!!!!  Totally unprofessional.  I'm not even sure this guy was a registered taxi driver!   Coming home was even worse.  The driver never turned up to take us back to the airport.  He was scheduled to pick us up at 7pm.  I rang the company at 430pm checking everything was ok as the inbound journey hadn't gone to plan I wanted to make sure our town car would be with us on time.  He said yes.  At 645 the driver called to say he was on 47th street.  We struggled to understand him as his English was very poor.  Our hotel entrance was on 45th Street so he wasn't far away.  At 710 he still hadn't arrived.  We kept calling.  He said he was nearly there.  I started to feel uneasy and suspected the driver didn't know how to get to the hotel entrance.  We couldn't understand what he was saying to us.  At 730 I started to panick and after checking with the hotel staff and finding out there was a 40 minute wait for the yellow cabs we got in the queue still hoping our town car would turn up.  At 750pm I started to feel sick and scared that we would miss our 1050pm flight.  At 8pm a doorman told us a city car had just dropped someone off and he could take us to JFK for $130.  We jumped in. We arrived at JFK at 910pm.  I was physically sick when I arrived there.  One of the other airports had shut down so the airport was manic.  Security took ages.  We got to the gate with minutes to spare.  If we had not got that city car and waited for a yellow cab we would have missed our flight.  In total there were 25 calls registered on my husband's mobile phone to the driver and SF Best Limousines.  They never called us back.  I have complained to Expedia and once again experienced a very sickening feeling as their response to me was uncaring and very casual.  They told me they had checked with the vendor who told them we had given them the wrong hotel address!  Absolutely NOT TRUE.  The collection times were arranged in advance by email with the correct times and hotel address stated in my emails which they confirmed.  I have these emails to prove it.  They have dismissed my complaint.  The guy called Sandeep who has dealt with my complaint needs to be trained in english grammar and customer service skills.  I am so upset by this ordeal.

They came through in the end!
","I recently booked a holiday to Florence through Expedia which at last minute was cancelled due to a general transport flight for that day in Italy which meant my outgoing Easyjet flight was cancelled. My flights and accommodation had been paid. I did make a couple of calls with Expedia who were to contact the hotel to attempt to obtain a refund from them. The hotel refused a refund as this was out of their control and Expedia promised to contact me the next day after escalating the matter with the hotel. My return phone call did not arrive - however, upon returning from an alternative last minute break that I arranged to Prague, I again contacted Expedia - though the hotel have continued to refuse to refund my accommodation, Expedia is now in the process of refunding my cost and a credit has been received from them. They could easily have refused this, but have accepted that my failure to travel was beyond my control. As for the refund of the flight cost, I am currently taking this up directly with Easyjet. To be fair, I was preparing myself for a drawn out battle to recover my outlay though thus far this may actually be a fairly simple process."

Absolutly appauling customer service, and total disrispect for customers
","Below is the Email I sent to expedia after contacting there customer services 3 times when they messed up my holiday booking which was supposed to be all inclusive but when I checked in it was self catering and to make it worse a family of 5 we only had 300 euros and they coudn't even be bothered to treat it in any way and didn't even call back even though they said it was priority and I would get a call within 24hrs, and even after sending this email and them assuring me I would be contacted in 28 days they never bother 45 days later.I WARN YOU NEVER USE THEM BECAUSE IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM THEY DONT CARE ONCE THEY HAVE YOUR MONEY!""I am very saddened to say that after many years of using Expedia for my travel plans, I will no longer be using your service.This is only down to the appalling customer service I received during my last to Mallorca, on arrival we expected to be booked into an all inclusive stay, whilst checking in the hotel informed us that our trip was only self catering I disputed this and rang your customer service team this was approximately 9pm GMT, on discussion with your customer service agent it was quickly established that he had no idea what ?all inclusive? meant. We told me that our trip booked was booked all inclusive and then told the hotel that it wasn?t. Following this I asked that a manager would call me, I was told a manager would call within 24hrs.After not receiving a call 24hrs later I then rang again I spoke to a lady and after going through the details and explaining that I only had 300 euro?s she assured me that this would be escalated and I would receive a call within 72hrs once again this did not materialise by now I had to ring home and have money transferred over so we could eat.I then rang 4 days later giving your customer service team an additional day to contact me, I spoke to a team manager at length about the poor customer service that I received and the fact that I regardless of the main issue there should have at least been a follow up call, once again he promised a member of the escalation team would call to discuss the issue and he would personally follow it up and ensure that I had a response within 24hrs! Once again I have heard nothing for 17 days now.You have the issue noted but I will put it down again, I am certain when I booked it was all inclusive as there is myself, my wife and 3 kids so we always book all inclusive, on my itinery there is no mention of the booking being self catering, so I assumed that it was all inclusive so I did not check any further. I am still awaiting an answer from your escalation team in regards to this as I was told they would check the listing on the date it was booked.Regardless of the above it is disgusting that I had my family with me and only 300 euros and your team did not even treat this with the urgency that it required.I have spent over ?4000 with you this year on 3 seperate trips yet your customer service do have the common courtesy to actually do what they say they will, it seems like you no longer appreciate your customers and for this I can no longer use your service.It is now to late for this issue to be addressed for myself as have lost all confidence in your service, but all I ask is that the incompetence of your customer service is addressed as I would hate for anyone to have to endure this, especially if they are not so lucky to have someone who can wire money over to them.This could have all been resolved by a simple email or call. I called 3 times and was assured someone would get back to me.Deeply disappointedplease see the references below:Complaint Reference Number: 24784360Itinery Number: 110730457376"

Avoid the entire pyramid
","As a long standing ""customer"" of Owners Direct, who will not be renewing once my subscription expires, this dreadful company gets my zero star rating (I wish) as they are the parent and equally culpable. It's Expedia's ethos that has poisoned previously excellent companies. Avoid all of them and contact and book directly with the property owners. E-mail or phone the property owner - you can then judge for yourself if it is kosher or not and 99.99% of listings are, despite the lies and scaremongering put out by this bunch of sharks. There is nothing that they do that gives you any more peace of mind or protection and arguably, because the whole booking process is automated, you have less chance of avoiding scams. Even if their websites prevent you from dealing directly with the owners, more often than not Googling the name of the property will find the owners own website. Owners Direct, HomeAway and Expedia are the ones scamming, lying and cheating, not the owners. If you are considering booking a holiday home read all about these odious companies on TrustPilot first, then decide who you want to deal with."

Complained to Expedia, 7 hours of calls over 8 days, customer services offered 10% reduction and admitted fault, I turned this down and asked for them to help me book alternative accommodation, this was eventually agreed but in final stages of sorting the Escalation team retracted all apology saying this was stated under nearby attractions (in hidden 'to expand' section) and that it was a family friendly amenity as children over 17 could use.

","Booked a rental car through Expedia to collect in Milan's airport. When we arrived and came  to the counter to collect the car, the car rental's advisor did not give us the card because we did not have a credit card. Apparently you can only leave a deposit on a credit card. He then told us to call Expedia for a full refund. So I phone Expedia customer service straight away - waited 30 minutes for the customer service team member to contact the car rental and then just got cut off. Phoned again, waited 40 mins and the operator just apologized and promised to call back. He never called back. Still not refund.

Do not book with Expedia
","Yet another one of my flights was changed by the airline to an unacceptable schedule. Nothing new here. However, it took Expedia a total of 4 months to refund me the total fare, even though their website states that refunds are processed within 2 weeks. It took a number of calls, on hold for 40 minutes, emails, contradictory responses and threats to complain to the Civil Aviation Authority to receive the refund.  However, the booking fee, which should also be refunded by law, was not refunded. Despite a number of emails (tired of calling) there was no refund and no response to the emails. They probably think that people are not aware of the law and will not bother to chase for ?3. In the end this was filed as a complaint with Customer Service and the ?3 was refunded. I am pretty sure that it is their official policy to make refunds as difficult as possible and they ask people to call a different number for the booking fee to be refunded, even though it is their responsibility to give the full refund and this is taken off the card as a single booking. I get many cancellations on this route and I have never had to chase anyone like this for a refund. I have never seen a professional organisation ignore customers' emails either. I will never book with Expedia again and would advise anyone to avoid them as much as they can.Please, read another review of mine about Expedia for another flight."

Would rate the customer neglegance 5/5, cannot fault them on that! The neglagance department should receive an award this year, whoevers managing this team of thieves WELL DONE Shoutout to Turkish airlines who's 'name change policy' has been the cherry on top of this experience Be careful you may be robbed of your holiday too."

Extremely bad experience.
","Booked a holiday to Barcelona for our honeymoon and have now received 4 changes to our flights which do not fit in with the hotel booking and schedule. After many hours of calls most of which we have been sitting on hold plus confused responses which we were advised they would call us back were communicated by email asking us to call them.  Finally we decided to cancel which was confirmed and agreed with the scheduling agent only to receive a further call from someone in customer support advising that the hotel was no refundable and then proceeded to tell us they were confused.   Still waiting to find out what's going on.....also if they do proceed with refund then we have wait 3 months for money to be back in account...what has happened to this company!!!!Thanks for your reply, Itinerary number is 112552888279"

Have never imagined such incompetence
",Where to start:Flights left unconfirmed with BA despite sending us confirmation email.  Only noticed by chance otherwise BA would not have let us on the flight and we are travelling with a baby.Promised call back within an hour by three different call handlers who never called back.Initially told no cost for change to a booking then called back to say actually ?3000I could go on but I have spent 5 hours alone on hold to Expedia nevermind being able to talk to anyone.  Just never use them.  Ever.

Price Guarantee Not Honoured - Rohan has rectified
","We have booked and paid for a hotel in Cancun. I later found the hotel cheaper with Love Holidays. I asked Expedia to Price Guarantee and have sent three emails - no response on the latest email since Friday. I have sent Expedia numerous emails detailing the like for like matching of the hotels and they are asking me for more information each time.I am sure this is a case for Trading Standards. Expedia please can you advise an email address to contact with regards to thisUpdate: Expedia Reference is 7215275936394and case number is M-15101921. Last night I spent 45 minutes on the phone to Expedia only to be told this would be passed to the support team to investigate within 72 hours! 8 days later and still no resolution. I have sent screen shots from competitor, screen shots from the hotels website with no help given. I have emailed the ASA with regards to this as I believe I have supplied all information needed. From your guarantee ... If you book and pay for a hotel room on Expedia.co.uk and later find a lower rate for your hotel room on our site or another site just let us know and we'll refund the difference to you. It's that easy. ..... It is not that easy!!!! The room types are the same. Expedia claim the rooms are not the same. On Expedia it says Standard Room, Ocean View.... on the competitor site it says Double Room with Balcony/Terrace and Sea View .... The hotel website states there is only one standard room so if Double room and Standard room is not the same there is something wrong. Maybe one with Sea View does not match description ocean view!!!!!Thanks to Rohan and his quick response my Pricebeat Guarantee has now been resolved"

Itinerary: 7201153623679
","Absolutely appalling service. We booked a car with Dollar via Expedia for our New England trip. Booked and paid with a Visa Debit Card. When we arrived in Boston to collect our car we were informed that we couldn't use our Debit Card and needed a Credit Card. We don't have a credit card. No where were we informed of this policy regarding Debit Cards. We called Expedia for assistance but were advised we'd need to cancel the booking and make other arrangements elsewhere. I asked Expedia for assistance booking a car with a company that did accept Debit Cards but they were unwilling or unable to help. This effectively left us stranded in a foreign country with our only option to approach the car hire desks in Boston airport and try and get a new car. This was considerably more expensive. Expedia have failed on 2 counts. 1: properly informing us of the policy regarding Debit Cards and 2: assisting in rectifying the situation. Although a refund for the initial booking has been promised (yet to see it in my account) this is clearly unsatisfactory and we should be fairly compensated for this stressful situation we were put in as a direct result of Expedia's failings. The customer service complaints procedure is basically email tennis with offshore staff who clearly aren't taking the matter seriously despite our requests for it to be escalated.Update 8th October:That's still unclear I'm afraid. I made the booking with a debit card. Other hire companies accept a debit card. The rules and restrictions aren't clear and are open to interpretation. It doesn't state what's not accepted. I had every reason to believe that a debit card was acceptable. Are the Rules and Restrictions pages on Expedia different if you select Alamo as the hire company? They accept debit cards so if that's the case the information from Expedia should be different. I reiterate that Expedia failed to properly inform us of the restriction in plain text, and if the rules and restriction information is different between hire companies then Expedia should have been able to assist us in resolving the situation at the time, rather than effectively abandoning us at the airport with no option other than to make our own arrangements.Update October 22nd.Expedia continue to refuse to accept that they are liable to for failing to properly inform despite undeniable evidence that the information on the Expedia website is inaccurate and misleading.I've submitted documentation that shows clearly that the information on their website does not align with that of the car hire companies themselves, which also reinforces my point that the staff at Expedia are not adequately trained, had they been they could have and should have been able to assist in resolving a situation which Expedia are entirely at fault for putting us in in the first place.More than willing to escalate further to Andy Washington (UK Managing Director) and/or take legal advise if needed.It's more than clear Expedia are at fault and made substantial failings in this situation.  It's a shame Expedia fail to properly investigate and hold their hands up and admit they made mistakes.Public complains and damaged reputation could be avoided.Update November 14thExpedia called last week and attempted to convince me that they aren't at fault.  Despite the evidence that clearly shows Expedia are at fault and were also arguable negligent the sheer arrogance of Expedia is breathtaking.Attempted to escalate via ABTA, however Expedia aren't members of ABTA, alarm bells there as there's no public governing body to arbitrate my complaint.Expedia take note, I WILL now be escalating publicly via the Citizens Advise Bureau.YOU ARE AT FAULT.YOU WERE NEGLIGENT.You have offered me a ?25 voucher which is insulting considering the loss i've incurred.I've given you ample opportunity to resolve the matter privately and amicably, I will take you to court if I have to.UPDATE December 2016.Finally a win.  Cash compensation from Expedia which i take as acceptance that Expedia were and are at fault.Other travellers beware, Expedia are not members of ABTA which means as consumers you have no safety net, no assurance of a fair deal.  Not being members of ABTA means Expedia aren't bound to an independent code of conduct and when something goes wrong there's no arbitration available.  In situations such as mine, where Expedia have failed to provide clear and unambiguous information which is in breach of ABTA's code of conduct you'll have an uphill struggle and you'll be faced by an arrogant and inflexible corporation who demonstrate very clearly that they don't put their customer interests first.I eventually proved i was right but it took a lot of time, effort and stress.  I have my win and i can hold my head up high knowing that i'll never travel with Expedia again."

Liars and Thieves!
","I recently went on holiday to Thailand last month. Through various tours and excursions, spending near ?3000 with Expedia.  Later in my holiday due to illness, I had to cancel one of the pre-paid tours. I did so over the phone and was informed there wouldn't be a problem and I would be refunded promptly. Nearly a month has passed without word or remuneration. I also initially hired a private car to take me from the airport to hotel. Only for another three people to apparently share this trip. I expressed my dissatisfaction with Expedia, as in essence I was mislead into paying for a more expensive shuttle bus. Only to fobbed off to ""bfscrd@support"".

Airlines won't take bookings or payments from Expedia
","Having spent several weeks researching our flight plans I decided to use Expedia rather than booking direct with the airlines as I have booked with you in the past and had a good experience but am shocked with my experience this evening.I have attempted to book two flights through yourself for 27 adults which means we would have spent just under ?5,000 with you. The flight we selected were outbound from Birmingham on 9th June 2017 at 08:55 with Vueling Airlines to Alicante returning on 12th June 2017 from Alicante to Birmingham at 18:10 with Ryanair.Knowing you only take bookings of up to 6 people at any one time I was prepared to have to make several separate bookings. However after entering all the correct details on the payment page it advised ""Your booking can not be made, wait a moment and try again"". After 20 minutes and several attempts and after double and triple checking that all the details I entered were correct I called your customer service number.The gentleman I spoke with was very helpful and apologised and we talked through the booking details. He advised it was due to booking with 2 different airlines id the reason the booking will not go through. I was taken back by this as that is what Expedia does; bring together prices to facilitate the best deal. I frustrated that it did not indicate this on the website but just prompted me to keep trying.The gentleman then advised he could make the booking for me so we went over all the details again including the traveller?s names etc. Finally when it came to payment he advise the payment would not go through and I needed to contact the bank to authorise the card for online purchases. As this was an account I don?t normal use for online I did so and he held on for me whilst I contacted the bank and they did this straight away.He then again went to process the payment for the Vueling part of the booking but advise that Vueling were not taking payments from Expedia. Again shocked I could not believe that a major airline would not take your booking or payments. After several attempts he was unable to process and asked if I would like to go ahead and make the Ryanair bookings and contact Vueling directly to make those slight bookings. I was very concerned as I wanted to book it all together to ensure availability, etc.Not having much choice I agreed for him to progress with the Ryanair booking. To my absolute astonishment he came back to advise Ryanair were not taking bookings or payments from Expedia either.   I was speechless and so was your customer care advisor. My this point it became apparent that not only are you having serious issues as two major airlines are not taking bookings (with full payments) from you. He apologised as much as he could, clearly it was not his fault but I am beyond disgusted. Having wasted 30 minutes on your website and 60 minutes on the phone I am left with no booking."

Deceitful company! Would never use again!
","This is one of the most deceitful companies I have ever used and am kicking myself for not reading these reviews before booking. Customer service agent said we had hold baggage then once we were charged at the airport a further ?80 each way I was on hold with them for 40 minutes trying to work out whether we had baggage or not. After 40 minutes on hold they said that they weren't sure but pay the ?80 and they'd sort it out. Once we paid, they emailed the next day saying that we should have checked a link on the day we booked which was 3 months before we flew. No email confirmation on our lack of baggage! Terrible terrible customer service! British airways should step in to sort this out!"

Bad Logistics - Between Airport and Hotel Shuttle Transport

Expedia and Nairobi Safari Club are Thieves !!!
","I booked a reservation at this location from September 25 to October 1. I PAID EXPEDIA IN FULL AND IN ADVANCE. On September 26, I learned of a family emergency back in the US. I checked out early on September 27. I was told by the hotel manager (Daniel) that they could not refund my remaining four days since I had made the original reservation through Expedia. I was cautious so I asked for a letter from the hotel stating my actual length of stay and that only Expedia could refund my balance. THEY GAVE ME A LETTER SAYING SO. On September 30, I contacted Expedia. The agent promised to get me the refund once he called the hotel to confirm. Daniel was not available so I called back on October 1. On October 1, ""Mark"" from Expedia (a supervisor) told me that Expedia refused to refund my amounts because THE HOTEL could only do so. I am outraged. These two businesses have defrauded me of SEVERAL hundred dollars and refuse to assist me. I STRONGLY recommend that you all: (1) avoid NAIROBI SAFARI CLUB at all costs; and (2) take your travel business anywhere EXCEPT Expedia.

Do not book car hire through Expedia
","Booked car hire on the web through Expedia. The booking, all on one page, showed the car was from Budget and the full CDW with Allianz. On arrival at Budget they said they had no connection with Expedia. Ten weeks after returning the car, Budget sent an email saying ""Hi"" we have repaired the car (for an impercetible rear bumper scuff), would you like us to take $1443 from your credit card. I rang to object so they took it within minutes. They said I would need to claim through the insurance that I had taken out when booking. Now Allianz says I was sold an invalid insurance policy by Expedia (despite taking $103 and issuing a certificate). Expedia says it's nothing to do with them - they just ""offer"" Budget and Allianz through their site. I will be pursuing this.Itinerary 7194678378106Having spent much of the night on the phone again, I can tell you they will tell you that the insurance was invalid due to my not being Canadian. My point is that Expedia sold me this insurance by asking if I wanted CDW on the same page as booking the car; it did not offer any choice of insurance - this is the one it presented me with; at no point did it check that my UK telephone, address and email were not in fact part of Canada. I chose Expedia as I thought it was an international travel company - how can you sell car hire linked to a policy that is only valid for Canadian residents in a tourist area just over the US border while never checking residency? And how can payment be accepted and insurance issued? How many hundreds of people are driving around Canada with your worthless CDW? Many thanksThe booking was made by searching for ""car rental"" while in Canada and clicking on the top (promoted) link which was available to all regardless of their nationality.Still not heard anything. Rang Expedia again and they said they would put me through to someone. Phone went dead. So far in last 24 hours I've spent ?68.47 on ringing Expedia which I expect to be reimbursed.Still no word on honouring the insurance claim. Not impressed.Update 1 Oct 2016. I've still not heard anything or had my insurance claim honoured. Please can you let me know when I will be hearing. I'm sure you wouldn't want to be seen to be taking someone's money and issuing a certificate for an insurance policy when you know their home address is in the UK, their phone number is in the UK and their email address is in the UK and then claiming that it was the wrong policy. ?843 has falsely been taken out of my credit card together with ~?100 for the insurance that was worthless, and now over ?80 on phone calls. This isn't acceptable.Update 3 Oct. Still nothingExpedia is a dishonest company. They are just frauds. I was given no choice of insurance and at no time to anyone check my UK residency before purchase despite giving a UK meail, UK phone number and UK email address. If I don't receive the money into my account today I shall have to take legal action to ensure Expedia acts within the law.Update 4 Oct. Still no honouring of the insurance policy.So you are a tourist in a foreign country. You take out car rental and tick the box for CDW. You have an accident. When you claim, you are told that because you are a tourist hiring a car in a foreign country, the claim is invalid - the insurance you were sold in the tourist resort is only for people who live down the road and could have used their own car. What kind of scam merchants are you? I thought you were meant to be an international travel company? How can you justify selling car hire with insurance attached to it in a tourist venue like Vancouver Island then say the insurance was not valid for tourists?Update 5 Oct. Still nothing and expedia.ca has now bounced all my emails from the last few days. Having spent ?65 on one phone call it seems they are not exactly easy to deal with."

Booked all inclusive car and charged extra on the spot. Poor Customer Service
","I booked a car via expedia.co.uk with Budget in Heathrow. The expedia agreement said it was all inclusive including airport surcharge, only need to pay for fuel.When I collected the car, I was told by Budget I needed to pay extra, for airport surcharge they said. No point of arguing because apparently I had the option not to take the car, which no one in their right mind will do 7am in the morning after just touched down so I had to agree to this extra charge despite the expedia agreement said that it was all inclusive.Got in touch with expedia afterward with copies of both the expedia agreement and the on-the-spot charge sheet, and only received one email replying saying that 'you agreed to the extra charge on the spot!' - of course otherwise I wouldn't have a car to use... End of communication as expedia did not respond any more after this...It was a prefect experience with all other hotel booking via expedia on the same trip but the car hire was just a disaster. Looks like expedia does not have any ability to bound or monitor car hire arrangements so I would recommend avoiding to book cars from expedia at all because price can go up on the spot - there is no guarantee they would honour their quote!Itinerary number: [now removed]Customer service number: [now removed]Post note: To the credit of expedia, they called me within a few hours of me leaving the review, and owned up the problem to admit that something went terribly wrong in the way my initial refund request was handled during the email exchange, and refund me.

Nightmare booking - Itinerary 7212002882201 Complaint - S-129244894
","REFUND NIGHTMARE - Incredibly negative experience when making attempts to book a hotel in Hong Kong for myself and disabled / aging father. Going through the booking procedure I made requests to have two single beds and an accessible bathroom. I was notified to make contact with Expedia should my booking not be confirmed within 24 hours. 24 Hours comes and goes and I initiate a phone call to ascertain if my request had been met. In the meantime my money had already been taken out. The telesales agent reports that the room I booked does not cater for the disabled thus an accessible bathroom cannot be provided. The sales agent puts me on hold and calls the hotel asking which rooms they have that can provide two single beds and an accessible bathroom. Having been placed on hold for a while he reports back saying in order for my request to be met I would need to change rooms. He suggested a refund for my original purchase and to rebook a deluxe room which he ASSURED (I repeat ASSURED) me had two singles and an adapted bathroom. I go away thinking great, all sorted. Two days later I receive an email stating the room I booked based on what the telesales agent said in fact only had a queen bed. I again have to chase this up with Expedia and after a lengthy phone call was told the hotel in question only provides queen beds with the accessible bathrooms. Was placed on hold again whilst the agent made attempts to call the hotel to 'try' to sort this issue out for me. Due to the time difference and the reservation staff over in Hong Kong ending their shift, the Expedia telesales agent stated he would call me back the next day no later than 1pm which he actually promised he would. So, the next day I'm waiting for the call and 1pm comes and goes. I decided to call Expedia at 1:20pm to find out what's going on with my booking. Deja Vu hits and I go through the same rigmarole again being placed on hold whilst the sales agent calls HK. Again due to the time difference the relevant staff needed had all left and the the sales agent suggested he call me back the next day. At that point I stated I was not accepting his offer of a call back and stated I expected a full refund based on Expedia giving me the wrong information and mis selling me a product. I was informed that to get a refund i would have to pay a fee. So in short, Expedia mis sells me a product and in order to get a refund I would have to be charged a fee!!! By that time I had been on the phone for an hour. Eventually spoke to a floor manager who stated that they would need 72 hours to listen to the original telesales call and offer a solution to my problem. My father has been recently diagnosed with a cruel disease and the hotel book was something nice for him to look forward to. However I do feel very much Expedia have very much defecated on what was suppose to be something lovely. I have to say I have used Expedia in the past before without any issues so this episode is very much an anomaly. That said, it has left such a bitter taste with me I don't think I could ever use Expedia again, especially when booking trips for the elderly / disabled. The sheer lack of customer service and support is truly shocking. I don't hold out much hope for a fix once the 72 hours has expired. here's hoping."

So far I've written to them twice and received no reply. I then tried travel @ expedia.co.uk and they didn't reply either. I tried the webchat - a waste of time - and finally wrote to the CEO Andy Washington on andywashington @ expedia.com, told him the story, pointed out his website says complaints would receive a reply within 48 hours and asking him to intervene. Guess what, three days later and I haven't received the courtesy of a reply. I've been an Expedia customer for 16 years, and have spent thousands on hotels and flights. Never again.Great to get a reply. Thanks, just a shame it required a public forum to get one. Itinerary 7173933249240Thank you for your two answerphone messages. Rather than keep ringing please email me with your proposed solution. This has been dragging on for three weeks now and I would like it resolved quickly.The explanation I received from Expedia was that I was charged an additional $335 was because I returned the car a week late. I replied immediately saying this was impossible because our return flights were booked via Expedia, and various I had proof of attending various things (business meetings, medical appointments etc) in the U.K. when, according to them I was still driving around the USA. One other important event during the time we were apparently abroad was the death and funeral of my mother-in-law. It would not be unreasonable to expect any normal company to reply immediately saying (a) they would contact the car hire company to ask them to provide evidence the car had not been returned at the correct time and, at the same time (b) expressing sympathy for the inconvenience caused at such a depressing time. Expedia's response was ..... nothing at all. I eventually got this sorted out by my credit card company, who were extremely helpful. I have used Expedia for nearly all my flights, hotels and car hire for 16 years and will never use them again. I understand that, with any large organisation things occasionally go wrong. However, what is important is what the organisation does to put them right. Expedia has absolutely no interest in resolving problems or assisting customers - I suppose they have so many they don't really care if they lose a few. As the only way of getting any response from them at all is to post a negative review on Trustpilot why don't they just post a link to this site to avoid customers and ex-customers wasting their time sending emails to their so called ""customer services"" who never reply.Well, I did get a fairly instantaneous reply:Hi Paul, our priority escalation team is working on your complaint and they will contact you shortly to discuss this further. Thanks ^M Unfortunately, that's as far as it got. Despite the ""priority escalation team"" being on the case I haven't heard another word. Par for the course, really. Perhaps the ""non-priority escalation team"" will do better. I won't hold my breath."

Bad Customer Service
",Itinerary no :7181856428282Complaint No : M-14668737I booked a car for my recent holiday with Expedia. Had problems at the car rental desk and had to end up paying the same amount again to get the car we had already booked. Complained to Expedia on my return. Have had a month of buck-passing from them ever since.Have sent numerous e-mails and have had to call 4 times ( at least half an hour per call). Have to go through the same story every time and no one has a clue what has been done or which department is even dealing with my complaint. The only consistent message I get is that the car rental company is not replying to e-mails or answering calls - hardly inspires confidence about the companies they are choosing or dealing with.Am still ?160 out of pocket.Will never book a car with Expedia again

Took thousands out of my account through multiple bookings.
",Dreadful. They have wiped out my account by processing a booking 8 times running into thousands of pounds and when I speak to customer services they are doing nothing to return the money in less than 72 hours except giving me the run around and leaving me penniless till then.  They are now trying to say I authorised all 8 payments to get out of issue. The worst thing is when making the booking they asked if I had another card as the payment was not going through so I am just grateful I am not out of pocket more. I wish I had read all the newspaper articles I have now found  before I tried to book as it seems they have done this on numerous occasions with some waiting months for the money to be returned. Finance said they would all within the hour - that was 2 and a half hours ago.

Shocking processes for refunds
","They made a spelling error in the name on on an air ticket and admitted their error in late May.They cancelled the ticket. They warned me that the refund for the incorrect ticket would take 2-12 weeks. I checked with the  airline and they told me that refund processing takes 7 days. I then discovered that Expedia didn't actually cancel the ticket till mid July. Endless emails and conversations later, I decided after 16 weeks that I had no alternative but to issue legal proceedings in the Small Claims Court. I was paid in full, including legal costs within 7 days! their procedures appear to be designed to use their clients as sources of finance and I would recommend anyone experiencing the same to begin legal proceedings as soon as is fair, in order to get their attention"

Very bad
","I wished I read all the reviews before actually even thinking of booking through this website !! I found a good deal with I thought was good enough to take my little boy to Disney land for his birthday , only because some friend recomanded them . Well as I directed to the payment a message showed up that there was an error and that I could try again in few min , I did and still the same message showed up . I decided to ring the number on the website , the guy I was speaking to went through the whole booking process and by the time he took my cards details it shows that I didn't have enough money on my card . Shocked I rang my bank which it confirmed me that this company been trying to take payment 5 times which 3 of them went through plus leaving my overdraft empty with bank charges about to come later today . When I called costumer service they said it was an technical error and they will write a note for the money to be refunded into my account today plus they send me a 25? voucher . After 3 hours on the phone today i am hopping my money does come back into my account tho I doubt it I will be booking anything with this company ever again !! I've wasted 3 hours , my son didn't go to nursery due to me being in the phone and I am 600? something short . Costumer service was good tho I will see if my money does get back today into my account !! Taking 5 times the money is a joke , twice it could be a mistake but 5 times is totally a joke"

Charge for no booking
","I went online on 12th july to book a weekend for our anniversary  in September.I selected the hotel and started the booking but never completed. Unfotunately it turned out we could not make that weekend so I left it incomplete.I had an email from expedia prompting me to complete the booking which was at 92pc. I tried to ring them and got an automated system. As I had no booking ref I input the phone number of the hotel , which it did not recognise.Several tries later I gave up.Since then I have had 44 emails telling me to complete. This morning I checked my bank to find I had been charged 50 pounds for nothing. I tried all ways to contact expedia but finished up with the parent company Eviivo , who simply said there was nothing they could.So now I am light 50 pounds which as a pensioner I cannot afford.I will never trust this firm again..!!!!"

Dreadful service after accommodation overbooked
","Itinerary number  7210360322274Booked accommodation at the Albany House Luxury Serviced Apartments in central london yesterday with Expedia. All confirmed by Expedia  email, which stated i would receive 'arrival instructions' directly from the provider.Expedia told me in the confirmation email "" Guests will receive an email with check-in instructions prior to arrival. For more details, please contact the office using the information on the reservation confirmation received after booking.""At 11am this morning as I had not received any email, I telephoned the contact number for the apartments given by Expedia (a UK mobile number) and after giving my name and confirming I had booked with Expedia, I was told that there was no booking in my name, and that they were fully booked and unable to accommodate me. Advised by the person I was speaking to to take this up with Expedia.So I immediately called Expedia, explained, put on hold and eventually the agent confirmed that after calling the apartment manager there was indeed no space for me. By this time (the call lasted 22 minutes) I asked that they simply arrange a refund, which was acknowledged as I was allegedly redirected to the 'finance depatment'. However, I never spoke to anyone there as I was redirected to an automated choice menu at Expedia.Com, and when I finally spoke to someone they told me they couldnt help as it was an Expedia.uk problem.So, starting again, called and went through the whole problem again. This time the agent could not raise the manager of the property and suggested I call back later. This I refused to do and after confirming my phone number was promised a call back once Expedia had confirmed the overbooking / booking problem. Needless to say, I received no call.Meanwhile I had had to make alternative secure arrangements for my planned evening... cancelling a meeting etc...So lets try again to get a refund. Called. Same rigmarole. No record of previous calls, so yet again a need to call the property directly. After some 32 minutes of the call the agent said, good news, the booking has been confirmed. At which point I lost it... I had already been told both by the property manager and confirmed in my first call to Expedia that the booking was not possible and had had to make alternative arrangements.I therefore asked for a refund but was told that they would register my request but that as my money (actually my credit card companies maney) was already with the supposed provider, it was they via the finance department and not Expedia who would have to make the refund.I await further development, but as I see things I had a contract which was acknowledged by Expedia as not met. In my view they are responsible directly for this refund .... or am i just too naive ?? Expedia sucks guys.... they are happy to take your money but completely hopeless and unwilling to assist in a meaningful way when one of their suppliers screws up."

Car rental going bad
","I used Expedia.co.uk to schedule a car rental in Portugal. When I got there, the company did not had my reserve, as it was said it was cancelled. I had to make the full payment at the moment I got to the shop, paying almost 10 times more than what Expedia set my rental. I placed a complaint (Case ID : [REQ:M-13644705]) and NOT EVEN the value I payed for Expedia was reimbursed (intinerary 7177649143171).I have done all that I could, sent many email, and send them all the documents asked... Since they promised reimbursement for the rental I had to pay extra. It has been months and NOTHING.I promised myself I would do whatever it takes so no one else uses Expedia.co.ukIt is not worth the headache.They provide the worst service and customers service ever.After 6 months changing, they did reimburse me. I had to insist and complain in many places to make it happen, but my problem was solved.If you have a similar problem, I suggest you insist and place as many online complaints as possible, if your first contact do not work... it took a long time, but they did deposit the money."

Worst ever experience!!
","I've always used Expedia in the past 5 years doing 3-4 trips a year. Usually everything goes ok but on this occasion I booked a trip to Dubai back in May 2016 over the phone was given a package flights & hotel with all inclusive and the price was ok. After booking 5 mins later got a confirmation email but the all inclusive option was not there but just showed bed and breakfast. I called back showing the error and they wanted more money for all inclusive even though I was quoted with all inclusive. Anyway after few phone calls Expedia reviewed the recording and found that the issue was indeed Expedia's fault and added the all inclusive option to my booking which they sent a confirmation email so after that I put things aside knowing everything was OK. However, week before I'm due to fly out I decided to email the hotel for confirmation that my booking is in place which I always do and they inform me that there is no booking. I promptly call Expedia to check and after 20 mins holding on the phone been told that the hotel has been booked so I call back the hotel to check and they say NO booking under my name whatsoever! At this point I'm getting worried and call back Expedia and after another hour holding they just transfer me to the hotel directly for me to deal with them direct. So I hang up the phone and call Expedia again and the saga continued from 10am to 3.30pm! At this point I lost my temper and did have a go at one of the reps who just put the phone down so I called back and a girl called Pryia answered and I decided to do a conference called between myself, Expedia and hotel till this was resolved which in the end it was and only took 15mins. For further protection I got both parties to send me email confirmation on the booking if things go south again. To be honest I don't think I will use Expedia again I don't see why I should be doing the agents job and banging heads together to make things right. This was the most stressful day I have ever had and having my mobile phone glued to my ear for 5hrs and to top it off lost a deal on a property because I was on this call with Expedia. Thank you very much for ruining my day. My itinerary number 7185079409273."

They make promisses they do not keep.They keep saying they are sorry and that they want to help, but when it come to it they do nothing. After an hour on one call they offered to make a refund but then said they could not put it through as their system was down. No one will give appropriate feed back or resolution. Their answer is always to contact someone else or to ring them on such and such a number to get help. When this number is rung it is going over the same thing and not getting anywhere.I have spent ? 309 more than I needed to on a holiday because of their lack of customer orientated service.

Can Expedia 'Walk the Walk?
","Welcome to the on-going saga of Expedia 'Talking the Talk' but failing to 'Walk the Walk' having finally confirmed that, yes they HAD charged me twice for the same flight & the refund back in my account within three days-well, that was two weeks ago!. During my forty minute phone call this evening to an extremely polite 'A' (I can't write his name as it is deemed to be inappropriate language)-'A' now tells me that the Qatar Airlines refund would take a further 2-12 WEEKS. Er-no guys, it'll be best for all concerned if you refund my money now. Here's some suggestions for you (Expedia) which you may find useful:1) Do as you have promised. (Important)2) Have actual contact details ie a land line OR a direct e mail address, you know with somebody's name so that we, your increasing number of 'passed over' & forgotten victims can get some redress.3) Get the staff in your remedial department to 'follow through' to ensure that your clients have received satisfaction-I have had responses with I think seven of your operatives so far & fear that there may still be many more to come before this saga runs out of gas! Hey, Barry Diller I hope you get to read some of this stuff-it sure makes me wonder why I ever booked with such a bunch of cowboys.

Terrible customer service
","I am extremely disappointed with Expedia. I called them on the 13th August to extend a trip. The first customer service representative was rude and not knowledgeable so I called again to try my luck for someone better. Luckily I got through to a lovely lady who helped me find the right booking and said she booked the flight and I accepted to pay the change of flight fine. 3 days before the flight the traveller called Expedia to confirm his flight and was told that his tickets had been cancelled. I spoke to Expedia to try and get some clarification on what happened and I was told that the seemingly lovely lady had not correctly issued the ticket which caused the airline to completely cancel the tickets. The customer service team was unable to help me resolve my issue and promised to call me back the next day (today). They did not call so I called them again just to have them say they will call me tomorrow which would be one day before the flight. I told the customer service team that is unacceptable and I need the confirmation today. And they told me to wait an hour for them to try to resolve the mistake they made. I am now patiently waiting to hear back from them in the hopes they have managed to resolve their unacceptable lapse. Neither me or my family and friends will ever use Expedia to book anything.Itn # 111249428618 The update on my case is that after not receiving the call I was promised yesterday I called, got put on hold for thirty minutes before the call disconnected. I called again and after spending 90 minutes on the phone I got a new ticket issued however it is not on the same airline, at the same time as my original flight and also without the layover which I purposely booked as the traveller needed the time there, as according to the floor supervisor the ticket was too expensive and clearly they did not want to take any real responsibility for the mistake they made. Due to the fact that the traveller needs to be back in the United Kingdom I was worn down by the useless customer service and agreed to have them issue a flight that messes things up for me and the traveller. Not even close to an acceptable resolution!Please give me a number I can call or a way to message you privately to give you my number. The traveller is unavailable right now."

Fraudulent deceptive tactics to misell to consumers
","September 2016 update: after over 100 emails sent, they have refunded the charges for the hotel & premium number calls.Please see Expedia CEO (Chief Executive Officer) details at the end.My case:-Because Expedia representatives continue to lie over the phone or provide empty promises that never materialise, I have requested all communications to be in writing....9/8/16 hotel book through Expedia uk at London Kings Cross (central London) in order to easily catch the Euro star very early in the morning.Hours before travelling, Expedia changes the address of the hotel from London Kings Cross to Harrow (14 miles away).Customer wronged in 4 different ways:1) charged for a hotel not booked2) left stranded without a hotel 3) wasted 5 hours & ??? on telephone calls Expedia, on the day of travelling4) lied to over the phoneExpedia refuses to answer all written communication.When talking to their custmer service, do record all conversations as they say one thing over the phone and deny it in writing.29/8/16 my reply to expedia note on this review:Copy of latest communicationRe: -  Serious Fraud Case ID : [REQ:M-14721397] itinerary number: 112803482896And this is exactly why I am accusing Expedia of ""FRAUD"" because you have:-1) changed the original address in the itinerary to cover the deception. Rather stupid of Expedia as I still have the original confirmation of the booking ""including the original Kings Cross address""!!!, from Expedia to me ""as evidence"" against you in this fraud case (sent to Expedia & the CEO well over 50 times -  thus the CEO is aware of the FRAUD & seems to support it, which is a criminal offence carrying a prison sentence).2) you are, ignoring ""the"" email sent to me informing me that you (Expedia) had changed the hotel address from London Kings Cross to Harrow (over 13 miles distance!!!) only hours before I was due to check in.  Evidence of deception.I have sent copies of these two emails to Expedia, well over 50 times (and kept a record of all communications). Further evidence that Expedia is trying to delay facing the fact that you have:-1) tried to deceive me (the customer) for financial gain.2) tried to cover the deception3) have ignored my complaints & evidence emails included in my communications. .....I will not answer telephone calls from Expedia because unless is a long conversation, it is more difficult to record.  I prefer written communication.Expedia CEO (Dara Khosrowshahi darah@expedia)"

Useless company who can't even provide the most basic of pre-purchase information
","I tried to book a hotel at Disneyland Paris for October half term. The expedia app had a discount code making it the cheapest out of the Expedia family (hotels.com booking.com Expedia.com trivago venere all the same company but with different prices and discounts - shop around!).The hotel had 3 different rooms - room only / room with park tickets / room with park tickets and half board.Now try as I might - and I tried via phone / email speaking to 6 different customer service reps (based in India / Malaysia / the Philippines) I could not get a definite answer to 2 simple questions:1. How many days park tickets are included (website simply says park tickets - no further info)2. What type of half board is included? Disney have hotel only, standard, plus and premium and each level gives you access to more places to eat throughout the park (website simply says half board)You would think these would be straightforward for a company booking thousands of hotels an hour and part of one of the world's largest online travel agencies - think again!I had answers ranging from 1 days ticket for 1 person to tickets for us all for the 4 days we were staying. The dining question they could not answer and told me to ring the hotel. How would the hotel know what is included in a third party website advert. Nobody would commit an answer to email so I had some form of comeback on arrival at the hotel. The majority of the reps spoke incredibly poor English and were difficult to understand or make understand the points I was trying to get across. 1 even argued that the hotel was not even in France. Each seemed to just make up an answer and then proceed to read from a script.Incredibly poor show! I think I will book direct with Disney for piece of mind and to know exactly what I am getting before I arrive!I don't have an itinerary number to provide you, as stated above and in the title of my review, these were pre-purchase questions. I cannot book something unless I have it in black and white exactly what I am getting. If you can confirm the answers to the questions above I would be most grateful.

So many complaints
",I too had problems waiting 45mins to speak to an operator in the Indian call centre. All I wanted was to book a seat. I have no idea if I have to book boarding cards on line or if they are sent to me. In fact whilst booking is easy it seems to be the after care that's abysmal. So many customers are being treated with disregard by a company who main aim is to get your money. Expedia is finally protected by atol  no 5788. Can the disgruntled customers not complain to ABTA or their Insurance Companies and stop this malpractice in its tracks.

Do not honour Price match Promise
","I have used Expedia on many occasions without any problems. This time I was about to book a family holiday and had it online with Thomas Cook and Expedia. I decided to go with Expedia because of my previous experience. When coming to complete the booking it did not show All inclusive on the final page so I thought I had best check with them directly before paying. We were going to a family wedding so it was important to me that everything was as it should be. The Expedia operative confirmed that it was All inclusive but the price had just gone up ?100 as this was the last one available at this hotel. I panicked and said O.K lets get it booked. ( What he didn't tell me was that it was not the last place at the hotel but the last one with Expedia?)Anyway that was done and we were happy that it was all booked. The next thing is that the flight confirmation showed no baggage allowance and also no Transers. Within 24 hrs I contacted customer service and sent screen shots of the same holiday with baggage allowance and also transfer from the Thomas Cook website but was told that this was not like for like as it had transfers included??? What the hell does that mean???Its the same hotel, same package, same flight but with luggage allowance. Overall this has cost at least ?600 more with price, luggage and transfers. I felt that the Expedia operative took advantage of our situation and that we have been wrongly / inaccurately sold a product with a false promise of Price matching to make you feel secure when booking. I would not use Expedia again and I would not recommend them to anyone else. The first time something is wrong they dump you.

hidden costs-PAY LATER IS INCORRECT!!!
","I am highly angered by what has happened by using this website to book a hotel for my family. We booked to stay at a Hotel in Greece for 10 days next year. Now according to the website that if we book through the site we can pay a bit extra so that all we need to do is to pay the amount quoted to the hotel on arrival. There was no mention of any payments needing to be made ""At All"" at the time of booking, it was even showing on your website as ?needing to pay 0.00GBP?. Just a day later we have since come to use our bank account today and have found that we have gone drastically overdrawn (showing 0.00 available). Now we had nothing awaiting to go out, so we checked with the bank to see if there was a possibility of fraud on our account. After a 25min call they came back to tell us that a payment to the Hotel had been made, we questioned this as no payment should have been made to anyone and tried to explain to the hotel about making the booking through Expedia and no payment should have been taken from the account.This in turn led us to a 25min overseas call to the hotel direct to find out why it is they have taken money from us when we had used his site to make this booking and we even paid extra to make sure that we could cancel up to 24hrs before if something happened. They said that this is wrong on behalf of Expedia as the hotel say that no matter what booking is made that they always take a deposit of 20% on bookings, there was no mention of this on website, the hotel even took a look at making a booking themselves and said that you have your website wrong, it is very misleading and should be changed! Now this has led my fianc? and myself towards a very stressful expensive time, as we are now over our overdraft, will have to pay out for almost an hours worth of phone calls and the additional bank charges. We are trying to get in touch with the bank to reclaim the payment from the hotel but then we are at a loss of losing the booking at the hotel with having to reclaim the deposit that, according to your website, shouldn?t needed to have been made.ITEN NO 7205637414176UPDATE 27/08/2016 - After getting absolutely nowhere with Expedia and numerous calls / emails to bank and hotel at our own expense due to lack of response from Expedia not offering any real customer service or compensation for all the stress or even trying to offering to resolve the situation ... I would like to say that ....Expedia did absolutely nothing ...we ended up resolving the situation by cancelling the booking through this hurrendous website, we rebooked directly with the hotel offering a better trustworthy deal ...and Expedia ...dahdah...emailed to let us know ...what we already knew and sorted out ourselves CHEERS EXPEDIA!!!!"

Car rental information insufficient
","Booked a car from easirent through Expedia. Their lack of information about the rental companies rules caused me great inconvenience. Easirent says there is a rule that you need two forms of address ID other than licence. Expedia do not state that anywhere on there booking pages, in the links to their rules for the rentals or in the email. That meant I made a one hour trip to pick the car up and was told that I couldn't take the car because I don't have the ID. The manager also lied to me and said that this rule is visible on the booking page but it is not as I tried to book another one just to see if this rule shows but it doesn't. I told her to ring Expedia about this but she said she can't because of the ""data protection act"" and I'm quite sure she doesn't have a clue about the data protection act, or how my request would violate the act. I had to drive back home and then cancel the rental as it had already wasted 2 and a half hours of my weekend trip.Expedia refunded me after two days.Update , itinerary: 7204638338421)In response to your reply below:I know that I have been refunded, I actually stated that. The complaint was not about being refunded. It was about you failing to provide necessary information to your customers which resulted in much inconvenience."

Dishonest bait and switch and appalling customer service
","Itin #7185870361743I booked ""full size SUV"" car hire with Expedia as I was going up into the Italian mountains with a heavily pregnant wife and small child, and having been told about the quality of the mountain roads (read dirt tracks), wanted to ensure we were safe whilst out there.  When booking my ""Full size SUV or similar model"" I was shown a picture of an Audi Q5, which is a more than capable 4x4.  I received my booking confirmation, and again, it stated ""Full size SUV or similar model"".  All good I thought.A week before we were due to leave, I printed my online itinerary off, as I needed it to collect then car, and was shocked to see it stated ""Full Size SUV. Fiat 500L or similar"".  Let's be absolutely clear here, no matter how far you stretch the definition of the word, a Fiat 500L is not an SUV, let alone a full size one. It's not 4x4, and it's not built to handle dirt tracks and Italy's notorious white mountain ""roads"".Thinking it was an honest mistake, I called Expedia and spoke to a lovely lady who assured me that it was an error and that she would raise it to the escalations team to get fixed urgently.  Great I thought, as I waited for the issue to be solved.  And waited. And waited...With only a few days to go until I was about to leave, I chased Expedia by phone, and they again told me it was with escalations (although they weren't picking up so the lady couldn't confirm the status of my issue).  I emailed and eventually got the following response.""Re: Expedia travel confirmation - 13 Aug - (Itin#7185870361743) - Case ID : [REQ:M-14528523]Dear Andrew,We apologise for the delayed response.The booking was made on 30 May, 2016. The first complaint you made was on 6 August, 2016. Expedia cannot take any responsibility in this matter.We seek your understanding in this matter.Regards,Varun""So basically what they're saying is that although they lied about the booking, because I didn't discover the lie until the 6th of August (a week before we were due to collect the car), they are in no way responsible for the lie.  So dishonest I can't believe it!I'll never book through Expedia again, and would recommend anyone reading this avoid them with a long stick.Update.I've just received a call from Rohan apologising for the issues I experienced.  He's assured me they'll fix the description on the website, and has offered me a ?50 refund. I'd rather they fixed the issue when I identified it, but at least they've now responded."

NO Customer Support after taking your money
","I Booked a Flight, Hotel and car hire through Expedia for a business trip.  The process was simple enough. The problem I had was after travelling.We do have internal booking agents for this but as the destination was somewhere we do not normally travel, I thought it would be easier to use Expedia.As this was a business trip, I needed the invoice/receipt to claim the money I had paid,  back from my company. I have looked online how to retrieve this and it is supposed to be very easy. From the Expedia website:1, Sign in to view your bookings.2, Open the Upcoming or History section and select your itinerary.3, In the Price Summary section of your itinerary, select Get receipt.Unfortunately Get Receipt does not exist in Price Summary under my Itinerary for the trip that I booked. I have looked many times after searching the web. Even the incompetent support staff have told me to look there.  Lets move onto the customer support team in India.After not being able to resolve this I called the support number. I explained that I needed a receipt for the itinerary , broken down to show the cost of the Flights, Accommodation & car hire. I was told to use the website. Oh,  how I laughed.. Good joke, but unfortunately it isn't there. I was told that my details would be passed to ""The Team"" that deal with these issues and I would receive a response within 7 days. I never received a response within 14 days. I called them again.The second call I was again told to use the website. I informed them that I had actually tried this but it does not work. I also informed them that this is the second time I have called. I was told that this note had been added to the enquiry and that guess what?  "" my details would be passed to ""The Team"" that deal with these issues and I would receive a response within 7 days. I did get a response from travel support.expedia.co.uk:From the email ""Dear Mr. Bown,Thanks for contacting Expedia.We apologize for the delay and inconvenience caused.We are contacting you regarding the booking for  Guernsey.Please find the attached invoice for your trip.

Great Deal, Great Service, No Problems
","In my opinion Trust Pilot attracts reviewers who are quite often fired up about a company, due to a bad experience, and want to vent their frustration and do this by posting a negative review.  Whilst these views are clearly from the reviewers specific experience, readers quite often don?t see balanced reviews on a company.  We all expect good service and rarely find the time to post a review of a positive experience.I found a hotel in Santiago, Chile on Trip Adviser and contacted the hotel direct to see what deal they would give me for a 2 week stay.  Disappointingly the hotel was more expensive than Expedia so I decided to go ahead and book the accommodation online.  I received the confirming email from Expedia and that was it.  A little later my son was able to join us and I repeated the exercise booking an additional room in the same hotel but a shorter stay.  Again I did this through Expedia and again I received the booking confirmation.All paid up we headed for Chile.  Having read the many negative reviews on Trust Pilot I was half expecting to be charged twice for the accommodation but all I got was an $80 bill from the hotel for the extras I had incurred which were all proper expenses.  Not only was Expedia cheaper than the hotel but I also avoided the 3% surcharge that my credit card company was levying for any purchases in Chile.The only comment I would make about Expedia is their over zealous marketing department.  Having confirmed the booking they continued to bombard me with emails about the latest deals on the very same accommodation I had just booked.  The deals weren?t significantly better but it was just a bit annoying.All in all my experience with Expedia was excellent and I saved quite a lot of money.  Would definitely use this company again!"

Very disappointing customer service
","Dear Expedia,I don't know why you are leaving it like this because I still, after all this effort to get our money back, do not know a good explanation why this happened as the below story is the way it happened and it was not my fault.GerardAll,I have been very disappointed with the customer service of Expedia. I tried to change my holiday flight for the 11th of August to the 4th of August due to a unexpected business trip.The first disappointment was that it took a long time to actually change the flight. Every time they need to ""check something"" or ""bring up the details"" you are put on hold for 5 minutes. Even as simple as bringing up the booking details or other flights. This results in that every phone call will take at least 30 minutes to get anything done. In the current age, this is not good enough as general internet users can do it in less than 30 seconds from each request. After half an hour of this, I was told that to change my flight would costs about ?280 (?200 fee + ?80 for change in flight fair). I was okay with this but I needed to asked approval from my manager so I hung up the phone.Second disappointment, the next day when I got the approval I rang them back to book the change. After the standard 30 minutes, I got told that it would costs ?890 instead of the ?280. As you can imagine, I was very very surprised by this especially when a new flight would cost ?750. After speaking to the manager for about an hour, he told me I got lucky because the ""airline just released a seat on the flight for ?280""! Lucky me! If only I knew...So I booked the change in flight and the manager told me that the original credit card would be charged with the costs. Good. I checked a few days later and the booked was changed. I requested a booking confirmation as well just to make sure. I even checked with the airline whether they had the booking. Yes, we were all good, ready to go!Third disappointing (major one), came on the train on the way to the airport. The night before, after my bedtime, they've sent me an email that the change of flight was cancelled and I got back my original flight for the 11th! This was < 3 hrs for departure. Due to the reception on the train I tried to ring them but couldn't complete any of the phone calls due to the length of the calls (5 min for each on hold period).I asked my wife to take over as she could call them through a landline. She manage to get a shower during an on hold period and still be on time to answer them on time. (Complete phone call lasted 75 minute to change a flight!) Less than an hour before boarding she managed to have them change the flight (?550) however the ticket was not issued yet. Meanwhile as a desperate move because I had to get a flight, I booked another flight through my work because I could see this happening. Fourth disappointment, my wife tried to get some money back originally and they could give me ?70. There I was with in total ?2100 spent on a flight which originally costs ?680.During holiday, they were prepared to return a ""generous"" ?780 pounds because the customer service guy listened to my conversation and I supposed to not have booked the flight (even though I got the confirmation...? No sense!)All in all not a good experience and a lot of money lost for nothing.Thank you Expedia,Gerard"

Expedia directly caused me to double book my holiday - and blamed me
","Allegedly my first booking had been booked quoting an incorrect email address provided by me. When I rang Expedia after 24 hours to ask why the booking had not been confirmed - the girl searched for the booking using my correct email address and failed to find it. She told me that the booking had not been processed because the flight was fully booked. Having been assured by this girl, more than once, that there was no booking for me and that nothing had been or would be taken from my credit card, I booked again. When I next checked my credit card account I saw that I had been charged for both holidays.At least four major points remain unexplained:-1. How I had mistyped my email address when I was logged into my Expedia Account which holds my correct email address?2. Why couldn't the girl at Expedia Customer Support Services find the first booking using my name or my address or my telephone numbers?3. Why did this same girl tell me why my booking had not been processed when in fact, it had been processed?4. and most intriguing. I sent an email to the email address that it was alleged I had mistyped so that I could get my emails forwarded to me. I immediately got a response from the Postmaster saying ""Undeliverable: misdirected mail"". Expedia MUST have got this same message if ,,, and I repeat ""IF"" they had actually sent my emails there. So, why did they do nothing to reconcile this?A man from Expedia, Arizona rang me after I had been ignored by Customer Support Services for nearly two weeks and told me that the problem was my fault, that Expedia accepted no blame and that I would have to pay for both holidays, He further told me that the hotel booking was on a non refundable basis and that the airline was a low cost airline who don't do refunds. This - to me - fully explains Expedia's refusal to accept responsibility. I was told that I could contact the airline and the hotel direct and seek refunds but Expedia would not help me with this.My Itinerary number for the original booking is 7200417027382My Itinerary number for the replacement booking is 7200865860790I believe that I am entitled to a full refund for either one of these holidays because the second one would not have been booked if I had not been told that the first one had not been processed. However, Expedia are impossible to deal with. There is only one way to communicate with them, through their Customer Support Services, but they exist to protect the company, not to help the customer.Update 24/08/16 - Expedia apparently think that silence is the best policy. Ignore a problem and it will go away. I reported them to ABTA ? only to find that they are not registered ? so are they able to get away with this? I hope that they have retained their recordings of all my telephone calls - because I will need them.Update 29/08/16 - The silence continues to be deafening. The Expedia Agent whose responded to my first posting on this site and who has resolutely ignored the matter ever since must be up for ""Employee of the Month"" for sticking to company policy."

Took multiple payments and won't refund
","I tried to book flights through Expedias websites and got messages saying that 'due to an unexpected error the payment couldn't be processed' so I tried to book again with another card, payment went through and I got my confirmation email. The next day, I checked my bank account and saw that they'd actually taken money out of both accounts. I called them up, they explained that one of the payments was 'oh hold' and unsuccessful and that they'd issue a refund. I wait and still no refund. I phoned them up countless times and they keep promising to sort the issue and don't.

Utterly Incompetent
","I would first state that the 1 Star I've given here does not reflect on the quality of the support staff, who have always been polite - 0 stars would be my opinion of the company itself.However, so far the call centre have not only been unable to fix anything, but have actually made the situation worse!From reading other posts here it seems clear that this is Expedias normal operating practice, leave the people in the call centre to take the flack whilst the actual company drag their heals until repayment is unavoidable.I would urge anyone reading these reviews to take heed - I shall certainly never use this company again, and will recommend to my friends and family to do likewise.I booked a simple flight and hotel package for a trip to the USA lasting 3 weeks from late June. The package consisted of a return flight over 3 weeks, and 2 weeks at a hotel in my destination city as the Expedia system can only cope with a single contiguous hotel stay.When I arrived I asked at the hotel desk if I could move the final 2 nights of the stay, but they informed me Expedia had to rearrange it so I had to spend 45 minutes on the phone to the UK to Expedia support whilst they did this. At the end of this time Expedia and the hotel staff confirmed it had been done.A few days later, as a precaution, I called Expedia again to double-check and was again told, without me mentioning any dates, that the final two nights of my original booking had been moved from July 9-10 to July 16-17.A week later, as I was preparing to travel elsewhere I asked at the hotel desk as an extra check that they had got the dates booked and was shocked to find that all they had done was remove last two of my nights stay. When I expressed my surprise the hotel staff claimed that their system would have charged Expedia a lower price, so ?What was my problem??.I pointed out that I had paid in full in advance, and had been assured that the two days had been moved, but again the staff just said I had to take it up with Expedia.Running out of time, I was forced to make another international call to Expedia, where this time I was told a completely different story, in which it was claimed that they never could have moved the dates of my stay - even though I had had separate confirmation that this had been done, and the dates had been confirmed!Eventually the person I was speaking to claimed that the only thing they would consider - not even offering to refund the equivalent money they had already received from me for my booking - was that I should book the two nights of July 16-17, and then forward my receipt to Expedia and they would arrange a payment to me to cover the cost. Since this was following the sterling crash (I'd booked and paid before) it meant that Expedia would still keep a little extra cash from me.A totally farcical and convoluted solution, but I was given no other choice, so I had to do so.Having done this, I got an email reply stating that the refunded money would be in my account within 7 days.After 8 days I contacted them again, and was told:?Thank you for contacting Expedia.co.uk. We apologise for the delay in receiving your refund from Expedia. Due to technical issue refund could not be processed earlier. We have requested this refund to be processed again through our system and you should expect to see the refund in your account within 7 days.?After another 7 days I contacted them again, and was told:?We apologise for the inconvenience caused.We have checked the reservation and can see that your refund of 135.12 GBP did not process due to some technical issue. However, we have again forwarded your case to investigation team and your refund will take up to 7 days to reflect into the same account which you have used while making the reservation.?After another 7 days I contacted them again, and was told:?Oh yes, it looks like this has had another problem??Me: ?Really? Really???Call Centre: ?Oh yes, but now I?m going to give you a code that guarantees the transaction has genuinely been actioned.?So I add this code to my collection and wait, but not with baited breath?After yet another 7 days?I tried calling again but had to listen to the recorded message for 5 minutes saying they were too busy to answer, so I emailed instead with the full details above plus the 6 different codes I?d been given. After a couple of days I was called and promised that the money had now finally been actually sent to my account? And it did finally arrive about 5 days later!All it took was more than 5 weeks for them to fix the mess that they had created, and which they compounded by offering such a ridiculously convoluted solution to returning the money that they have fraudulently taken from me.From reading other posts here it seems clear that this is their normal operating practice, so I would urge anyone reading these reviews to take heed - I shall certainly never use this company again."

Frustrated and totally Unacceptable, beware if you want to book premium economy flight!!!
","I'd used Expedia before and like everyone else if it work out everything is good but if something goes wrong then getting your money back is frustrating and time consuming. Is been 7 days since this incident and every 2nd day I'd called Expedia back I'd to re-cap the history for the agent who I'm on the phone with.So Expedia website give you the option to select flight+hotel package with different Flight Class-economy, premium economy, business & first class.I wanted to book a premium economy class flight+hotel to Hong Kong, that should be quite simple since the website gives you that options. I was ready to book online when it gets to the final page, website say cannot book online please call Expedia so I did.Told the agent what I wanted and he advised that he CANNOT book premium economy class (not because is not available) is because Expedia cannot get this booking, what he suggested was that I book this as economy class then he would transfer me to a Sales Support Team who WOULD able to upgrade my tickets to premium economy, yes I know I would have to pay extra for the the next class that was not an issues, however, once I'd got transferred thru to the  Sales Support Team the agent asked if I'd contact the airline directly?!?! Why would I contact airline direct when I'm told Expedia can upgrade me to premium class??? So it turns out Expedia CANNOT book any other class apart from economy!!!! Even if their website gives you that options and pop out a price!!!!Sales Support agent said this will now class as a ""change"" to tickets and it would mean additional fee to change my tickets which is not what I asked for in the first place. Sales Support agent said ok it is their sales agent providing faults information he would issues me a full refund on the same day as this booking so I assumed everything would be fine.Naive I did not get a reference number, two days later I contacted Expedia again and was told I should get my refund back into my account with 48hrs. Two days later still nothing so called expedia again, recap the whole experience, was provided a case reference and again the promise the case and refund will be look into, 48hrs later still  nothing, called Expedia again, re-cap everything above and I'm told they cannot get hold of the hotel reservation due to time different to get a refund, I'm now having to wait till Monday and will be spending my Monday morning calling up expedia again and each time I spent an hour on the phone with agent who promises they will  personally deal/handle this case, not so because no action was ever taken unless I call to chase it up.Expedia agent who provided faults information in the first place i'm entitle to a full refund so WHY do I have to wait for Expedia to get confirmation from hotel to receive my refund????I was told two days ago my flights was refunded but I'm still waiting for this to reflect on my credit card!!!!!To be continue ........itinerary: 7202404212983Update - received refund for my flights on 14/08 bank into my cardUpdate - Expedia agent left a voicemail on Monday saying hotel will not provide refund and  call listening is requested to investigate. I called Expedia on the same NOT accepting above and demanded a callback with 4hrs.

Fine until it goes wrong!
","I booked a holiday for my son and me to visit Toronto this August (2016), I booked what I thought was a good airline in Air Canada and a hotel with excellent reviews... so far so good, it wasn't cheap but I got what I wanted.... that was until it went wrong. So here's what happened next:- The itinerary showed the Air Canada flight as operating through Air Canada Rouge; in case you're wondering, that's their low budget, no frills airline where the seat pitch is reduced by two inches, the seats aren't as wide, the seat recline is minimal, in flight entertainment isn't seat back but you use your own tablet, some food / drink is no longer complimentary (compared to Air Canada). Oh no, this is NOT what I wanted!- I inquire via phone; ""No, no, sir, it's quite all right it is Air Canada"" the lady tells me... I tell her that's what I thought but the itinerary says not. She checks again, she's still convinced it's Air Canada. In the end she transfers me to Air Canada and they tell me no, it's Air Canada Rouge. Sigh. Interesting that even their own employees thought it was an Air Canada flight.- Back on the phone to Expedia. The lady I spoke to seems genuinely interested, she tells me there's plenty of time and she will certainly be solving this issue for me. In the end she escalates the issue. Okay, I'm feeling confident.- Several days later I get an email from the escalations team, not a call. ""Sorry Sir there's nothing we can do, it clearly states Air Canada Rouge on the booking"". Okay, let's put this to the test, I log on and go to book flights - well it's true, in small print it does say that the flight will be operated by Air Canada Rouge, but only after it shows a picture of the Air Canada logo and the title says Air Canada. That's right, the fact you're not really travelling on the standard service is the third line down. I click to the next page, again, the Air Canada logo and 'Air Canada' wrote next to it, the mention of 'Rouge' is hidden in a collapsed drop down box out of sight. - In the email from escalations team they tell me that Rouge is a premium service, almost exactly the same as Air Canada... no no no, let's not go there, it's not, it's far from it. The both fly 767's sure, but one is cramped with no frills and the other is more comfortable with complimentary services (see full list of differences above). I write back... ""we'll look in to it""... sure, no problem, please do.- I asked on their Facebook site for somebody to help as the holiday is looming. Amazing, straight away somebody comes back to me and even calls me. Don't get excited, 'R' from the Social Media team wasn't going to be helpful, he'd called me to tell me it was my fault as they have 'expectations of their customers', 'they're a business', 'it's clear that it's Air Canada Rouge even if 'Air Canada' is the primary and secondary pieces of information you read, 'he's so confident because he's right', 'I've never experienced such a complaint', 'I won't be doing anything', 'Let me explain how the industry works...'. Hey 'R', what about actually taking the time to listen to your customer? Maybe even asking what they want from you? Maybe asking what they could do to make it better? No, nothing like that from 'R', he didn't care what I wanted, he just wanted to make sure he told me the way it was... he was after all 'so confident because I'm right'. R probably should take a class in dealing with customers.So here we are. A flight in ten days, no help from Expedia, they've not even asked what I want from them. Do they think I want a refund? Do they think I want a seat with a little more leg room? Perhaps a coffee at the airport? Maybe for them to make it clearer to users of their website which airline they're actually flying? They've never taken the time to ask.... after all, I'm just the customer, or an itinerary number, not something valuable or worthy.If Expedia ever take the time to read this, please let's be clear about this. Saying it's on the website so you should have read it more closely is one thing, but that didn't work for the banks with PPI et al, people are interested in the information being very very clear... adding an airline name in small print after you add the logo and large text name of another airline isn't clear, it's misleading.I've written processes for some of the biggest businesses in the UK, many of them complaints processes and rectification processes; never would I write a process where the customer is treated in this way, it's bad practice, it's bad manners and it's the quickest way to lose a customer especially because you've never even tried to help.Itinerary 111978209322--- Update 12/08/16 ---Interesting to read 'R' from Expedia's reply. Somewhat obvious he's not read the complaint above. The reply is typical of the service you can expect from Expedia... avoid at all costs."

Take your money and claim they never got it.
","This is my first time using Expedia and I'll never use them again, and I'll make sure everyone I know who considers using them avoids them like the plague.I booked a hotel a few months ago, got my confirmation email, money came out my account to pay for the room, everything seemed fine.I checked in to the hotel today, and they claim that the room was booked, but not paid for.

It's garbage, mickey mouse companies like this which makes me wonder why do anything nice, or even leave the house when there are so many companies that are either trying to scam you, or are just too idiotic to execute basic tasks - I guess I'll find out what category Expedia falls under.Update: Itinerary #112221923425"

Confirmation shows that for the return flights families aren't even on the same plane. On 2nd Aug I spent over FOUR hours on the phone.

Took the wrong amount for a holiday and won't refund.  TWICE!!
","I recently went to spend ?1800+ for a Tenerife Holiday on Expedia.  The company decided to take ?867 instead (nobody knows why)and then told me that I hadn't paid anything, blamed my bank (despite me having an authorisation number from the bank) and then after a lot of conversations said i'd receive the money back in 3 days.  Several phone calls later and I still haven't received, however I was told that the money was sent and it is down to my bank to accept it (my bank are aware of the issues). The price in the meantime also went up ?300!! I then received a voucher from Expedia today and going onto the website and having a look, the price had dropped to ?1600. I took the risk in doing it again, the holiday is in 8 days time and the amount was good so my choices were maybe a bit limited.  I phoned up this time because of the issues before and was told by the sales person that the transaction had been declined, this was not possible as the money was there and I was sat looking at a computer screen of my online banking and the money had left my account.  When I finally got through to customer support I was given the same excuse that the money was sat in a holding account and I will receive it back in 3 days.  I don't understand why they don't want the money, maybe having customers money for days is good when they are not giving anything for it.  I can't afford to do it again and if the money comes through, I expect the price to have gone back up, which was confirmed by the support lady.  So I have no holiday and am ?2500 out of pocket.  I now have to break it to my son that we will not have a holiday as Expedia are holding my money and blaming the bank who authorised the payment  DO NOT TRUST!!!

Still waiting for a refund 2 months later - Terrible Customer Service
","Booked 5 flights to Las Vegas in June 2016 with Expedia. Decided to reserve seats to ensure we were all seated together, so I rang expedia, booked the seats and they deducted ?211.06 from my card. However when we arrived at the airport on both the outbound and inbound flights, no seats had been reserved - This resulted in the group being split across the plane! We were obviously extremely annoyed that expedia had charged us and failed to reserve any seats, resulting in a bad start to the holiday!Obviously I wanted my ?211.06 back! I contacted expedia via email, and 2 months later they continue to try and fob me off. They have so far given me a token ?75 back. This is not acceptable.I have been a loyal customer to expedia for many years without issue. However, I will now question whether I use expedia in the future.

Truly atrocious service
","I would like to make a formal complaint about the way my booking has been handled. This was booked in October 2015 for a honeymoon. The customer had specifically asked to book this hotel to stay on Union Island and it was available to book on your website, I received a confirmation email from you stating everything was confirmed. Eight days before they were due to arrive at the property I received an email stating that the property is closed for off season at that time and they would need to be re-located. After lengthy conversations on the phone to the supervisor Carl who gave me a number of options which were not suitable at all. He said they have a limit of ?2000 to spend which would be fair if 1. They had been given more time to decide which hotel they would like to swap to and 2. If there were available options which fit within that budget available. We finally came to an option that the customer was happy with which is the Islanders Inn. I received a confirmation from Expedia stating it was all confirmed and Carl and Alice had said they had spoken to the hotel to confirm availability. When I came in to work today I had received an email from The Islanders Inn directly which states that the booking must be a mistake as they are closed for the off season until the 30th of September. There is only 1 hotel available on Union Island which is actually open during the dates selected and although the price difference is greater than the ?2000 allocated it seems ridiculous that given your room guarantee you would not swap them to this hotel. I have had to book the Davids Beach Hotel on your site separately as the people who work in your Reservation Services department were seemingly unable to book it. I except without questions a full refund both booking as per your room rate guarantees no charge and due to the hassle and stress both myself and the customer have gone through.The managers have all avoided speaking to me on the phone (Carl and Vin) ? I have had to call multiple times and spent roughly 20 hours on the phone to Expedia SO FAR trying to sort out this issue. This is not our problem and definitely not the customers. They should not be asked to be ?1700 price difference to stay on the same island they booked 10 months ago after being given a very short time period to change their honeymoon. If they had been given more notice then ?2000 would be ample amount to change but given the circumstances there should be no question they should be put in the David?s Beach Hotel. Your system (and staff) should be intelligent enough to not sell properties which are closed due to being out of season and especially not make the same mistake twice. This has been a huge waste of the customers and my time not to mention a huge worry for the customer who is due to be going on their Honeymoon in 5 days which is now up in the air. They booked this so early to guarantee they get the perfect Honeymoon and they should be compensated by being given a suitable hotel which is actually available on the Island they originally booked to stay on. This will not be left and I will escalate this within our company  (Flight Centre) who book multiple hotels with you worldwide."

Thieves that won't honour a ?53 refund despite spending 6k!!!
","NYC trip for 8 booked over the phone after 2.5 hours where the Expedia call centre (clearly based in another country with 'tactful' salespeople!). Please tell me how we should have to incurr the additional costs to purchase tickets made under the same booking but different transaction because EXPEDIA are unable to process 8 tickets in one transaction?! That's YOUR system fault which should be addressed, charging customers more is pathetic! Secondly stop telling porky pies with policies, misinforming and mis-selling customers! Never using Expedia again...may be cheap as chips but they are 'excellent' with organising their trips!?#NOT!#STOPSTEALING#EXPEDIA"

Awful customers service - sales people have no idea what they're selling
","Wanted to book a holiday to NYC for 8 people, so we called to ensure all of us got a flight and bed, however over almost 2 hours on the phone they tell us the price has gone up for 4 people!  Had no choice but to pay as we didn't want to lose the booking and half of our party to miss out! Ridiculous!!! Not even a warning to say the price may fluctuate, but made it VERY clear that we couldn't cancel or change the booking but had no choice but to pay, On the phone to customer services at the moment for a refund for the extra ?53, and just been told we actually could have cancelled the booking if we wanted to - so the sales people have no idea what they're selling!! What is going on Expedia???  Really hope Expedia come through otherwise that's is a disgusting way to do business and another big company shafting their customers!! we paid more than ?6k for this holiday!!"

DO NOT USE - Charged for hotel yet no booking.
",Tried to make an online booking yesterday for a flight to and hotel in Venice. All went well until the payment screen. Details put in and it came up there was a problem with system and to try again. I did not try again as had read about people being charged twice doing this. When I checked my bank account I was disgusted to see that the hotel element of the booking had been reserved against my card. I called Expedia who confirmed there was no booking made and the amount would fall off my card in 24 hours. This has NOT happened. They weren't really that bothered about the fact i'd been charged and no booking in force - all they were bothered about was trying to force me to re-book on another card! It is unbelievable that I am now awaiting monies to be put back into my account that they have reserved against my card. As if people can just afford to have their accounts debited and have not booking - it's shocking. I've rung twice and have to retell the story and still not got the money back.

Don't know why they employ humans. May as well be talking to a machine
","I booked two rooms for 3 people, with spare bed in one of the rooms, as advertised as an option on the website and ostensibly confirmed in an email from Expedia. After I'd booked and paid, the contact at Expedia mentioned, 'just confirm with the hotel'. This should have rung bells, but too late anyway. Hotel said the spare bed was not guaranteed, so possibly three (single) people, two beds. No one at Expedia warned that 'Special request' (for the spare bed) meant we might or might not get it. With no time before the holiday I had to book another room, an extra ?199. Have been arguing with Expedia for a full refund ever since (over 6 months) (they eventually offered ?50 towards another Expedia holiday (what!) which they then changed to cash). They just repeat, 'It is not our procedure', 'It is not our policy', 'I am unable to...' May as well be talking to a machine. Spare your life and book some other way - any other way... (Big business always wins.) (Hotel was quite good by the way - book direct!!)"

If I could give negative stars I could - AVOID
","Like most people I looked to Expedia to book some flights to Cyprus for ease of use.A simple transaction - just booking flights from London to Cyprus.  As it was a last minute flight they came in quite expensive at ?800 for 2 return flights.The payment gateway on the Expedia website was down and not working.  So I booked the flights over the phone as to not miss out on any seats.After an exhausting 40 minutes speaking to a call centre in India I managed to confirm the flights.  I was told ""your payment has gone through fine, we are just having trouble with our system contacting the airline"" - I naturally asked whether I should call back and process the payment again.  I was then explicitly told ""your flights are non-refundable and non-transferable, your card has processed fine, so we will automatically process your payment once our system can contact the airline.  I will call you back in 30minutes to confirm""An hour and a half past and no return phone call.  So another 30minutes on the phone to India trying to see what the situation was.  I was put through to a 'supervisor' and told ""I can see your booking here"" (and he confirmed all the details were correct) ""your card has been pre-authorised for the amount of ?800, our system is trying to confirm with the airline and you should receive an email shortly.""I was then left in a tricky situation - the flight being 2 days away I was obviously keen to get these confirmed.  I was told I couldn't cancel the flights as they are non-refundable, so I couldn't book via another website.  The supervisor told me he would call me back in 20minutes.He did not.I waited 2 hours and as no phone call or email had been received as promised I called Expedia to confirm.  I was then told that ""I'm sorry sir there has been a price increase.  The flights are now ?1,450""So in less than 5 hours the flight prices had increased over 80%I confirmed with the supervisor (who I demanded to be put through to) - that I had confirmed details and booked at the price of ?800 - they confirmed again that nothing was wrong with my payment and it was an error at their end - however they do not guarantee prices and cannot be held liable for changes in prices.  I was told that their system was back up and running, but I would have to pay ?1,450 to book the flights.Absolute joke.  I asked for the recording of the tape of the previous conversations.  From a legal standpoint, I don't see how they can tell me my payment has gone through at ?800 and the payment is non-refundable and non-transferable, to then hike the price up over ?600 with no warning, I was never told that this could happen and wasn't warned that I could lose the flights all together.  The supervisor told me 'we are in India sir and I am going home soon' so he wouldn't listen to the tape until the next day.I was promised a call back the following day.  Yet again. No call received.  I appreciate that Expedia do not control the price of the flights but I fail to see how this is my problem if I am told on numerous occasions that my payment was fine and I could not cancel.I was left with no option but to cancel the entire trip."

","Tried to book villa and flights through Expedia and we never got booking confirmation. So logged back in to check and kept getting a message to say booking hadn't hone through. Only to then find that they had taken the payment twice from card and so had to ring up. Person on phone spoke very bad English and kept putting me on hold without telling me to then be told the villa wasn't available hence the booking hadn't worked. I asked why the money had been taken and he replied thats how it works. Now waiting to try get our money back, but not getting any satisfactory answers.

HORRENDOUS!!!!
","Rohan, I answered the call but nothing on the other end and you did not leave any contact details, therefore, I have no other way of contacting you directly. Please call me again and I will give you my work landline number. I seriously hope that we can get this finalized, to my satisfaction, today. I honestly cannot cope with anymore,, conflicting information, stress, delay, lies, HOLD music, unanswered emails, insincere offers of help and empathy. The manner in which I have been treated is sickening. I spoke to another Expedia agent yesterday, who agreed to pay the balance of new, flights, once I have paid for the new flights myself and then WAIT to be refunded!! To add insult to injury, he offered me ?25 in compensation for the inconvenience!! REALLY!! This works out as ?1.25 per day and doesn't even cover the expense I have incurred, having to call Expedia 3 / 4 times a day for 20 days, you do the math!YES, this is now day 20 of this shambolic experience. In addition, I have emailed twice already today, but again, no response from the customer service team! Please bear in mind that I too have a stressful, fast paced, full time job and a young family who need my full attention! If action was taken immediately and the original call transcript was listened to, I would never have been put in this ridiculous situation. This nightmare is Expedia's responsibility, PLEASE take responsibility and HELP ME!!---Itinerary # 112527571767See copy of the email, that I have sent after 19 days of constant stress, upset, lies, HOLD MUSIC, same dialogue ""please do not worry"", incompetence, all due to the fact the the Expedia agent booked the wrong flights,,, how is that possible?? AND I am still waiting!! I need to sort airport accommodation, parking and car hire! Thank you for the email, acknowledging that you have finally after 18 days, listened to the recording of the original call on 7th July and that this whole disaster is due to the Expedia agents error. To say that, I am extremely disappointed, is an understatement!  At the end of the call on the evening of (GMT) 7th July, I felt the agent was rushing to get off the phone and I now fully understand why! I therefore checked my email for the itinery and noticed that the guy had booked the wrong flights. I immediately called Expedia and was told that I would recieve a call back within 2 hours. NOTHING,, and I waited, was placed on hold, was cut off, and I called and waited and waited until I finally gave up at 1am! Still, after 19 days of me having to constantly chase via email and daily telephone calls,  this nightmare has not been rectifed! I have been assured, every day by various agents, ""Please don't worry, someone will call you back within 30 mins, 2 hours, 24 hours, 48 hours, 72 hours!!!!!"" the only time I recieved a call back was yesterday after 18 days of being consistantly lied to. You are now asking me to book and pay for new flights and THEN you will refund the money, that I have been charged for the incorrect flights that were incorrectly booked by your agent, ARE YOU SERIOUS? I do not have the money available to pay for new flights and nor I should not have to! The flights that I originally specifically requested on the 7th July, are no longer available!  There are flights available with another airline, which are considerable more expensive! Also, when flying with them you do not have the option to just pay for one piece of hold luggage, you have to book and pay for four bags of hold luggage, return, at an additional cost of ?240! I only need to book two bags NOT four. I have sought advice and this booking error, constitutes a ?significant change' for the purposes of the Package Travel, Package Holidays and Package Tours Regulations 1992. Expedia has accepted responsibilty for the mistake and therefore must accept responsibility for any associated costs incurred as a result of this mistake.I therefore request that you offer me suitable alternative flights at no additional cost or prior outlay to myself. Expedia have a duty to secure and pay for new flights and compensate me for the time I have spent wasted chasing Expedia and the stress, suffering and upset that I am experiencing.I have worked hard all year to save and have paid ?2500, for my family holiday which should be an exciting time and I'm being treated in this appalling way!If this matter is not rectified, to my satisfaction today, I will start proceedings with small claims court, submit an offical complaint to the Ombudsman and will publically name and shame Expedia via social media forums & networks."

Lied to me.
","I rang Expedia this morning following the recent attacks in Germany. As you can imagine, being only 22, my family have begged me not to go and after the suicide bomber attack this morning my parents have flat out banned me from going. That may sound silly given my age, but honestly after all of this I just want to holiday somewhere local to me in the UK where I feel safe. I have close friends in Germany who have also told me to stay away for the time being due to the panic spreading across the country. I asked if I could cancel my holiday, the lady on the phone was polite and understanding and told me to ring German Wings to cancel my flight then get back to Expedia so they could refund me the hotel. I did as she said and cancelled my flights, so there would be no going back from that point. German Wings only refunded me ?58 of the ?148 that I paid for flights, I was very accepting of this at the time as I was told when I get back to Expedia I would get a refund.After an HOUR on hold I managed to get back through to Expedia, again the gentleman sounded kind and understanding and completely agreed with me that I should not go if it will upset me and my family. He got in contact with the hotel for me and was very apologetic when the hotel did not offer me even ?1 back. Their words according to the man on the phone were ""Nothing has happened in Cologne"" .. my response was that is very insensitive and ridiculous if there was an attack in London I would be fearful as I live 2 hours away why should I not be concerned about going to ANOTHER COUNTRY. Plus I was going to an event that would be filled with thousands upon thousands of people. I tried to stay calm, as I was told I would have a refund. I asked the Gentleman if, due to the circumstances, I could at least have the full amount back in vouchers to spend through Expedia, and I was put on hold for another 20 mins while he spoke to his admin team. For some reason they can't disclose whether I can have a voucher until August 1st?Felt very sorry for the man as he genuinely sounded let down by the response from his team and sounded very awkward.I am very stressed out and upset.  I used Expedia last year and did not have a problem, I had a wonderful trip and I always recommend people to the Expeida website. As an existing customer I feel very let down. I just want to go on holiday somewhere safe. I will happily still use Expedia if I get a voucher or refund, I just don't like how I have be fobbed off until a later date and not given a final answer.#111479089439"

Absolutely useless - would give none if I could
","We tried to book a holiday with Expedia over the phone as we had a couple of questions this Saturday. We wanted a hire car and flights and hotel in Rhodes. We gave credit card details to complete payment on the phone which were refused. We tried the Debit card, again refused. So while the call to Expedia (India) continued I rang my Bank. They said no problem the payment has been authorized, but it was returned by Expedia. So we cancelled everything there and then on the phone in the hope to book something the next day over the internet. However we since received an email from Expedia with confirmation of Car hire in Orlando Florida!!! Bit far to travel from Greece!So we called Expedia on Sunday morning to cancel the car and to ask if all payments from the day before had been cancelled, this was confirmed.So (stupidly) we tried via the Expedia website to book the same holiday, this time using my wife's email address as a reference to ensure no confusion. Same thing happened payment was not completed. Again we rang the Bank and again they confirmed all had been authorized bar the last three attempts. due to car limit exceeded. A total of NINE attempts by Expedia had been attempted to claim payment, all authorized by the Bank and then not completed by Expedia. Now left with a Credit card that has no available funds because of Expedia's incompetence and we don't even have a holiday booked because they cannot complete the financial transaction for reasons best known to Expedia?We called again and the guy from Expedia said he would email the Bank to reimburse the funds, you guessed it, today I talked to the Bank and they haven't heard anything.Will never use Expedia again as I am tired of not being able to talk to someone who can do something about the issue and doesn't tell you lies!"

Truly Inefficient and a Bunch of thieves as well !!
","Granted, Prices are good!Booking Number :112585471022I booked Flights from CDG to Seychelles & Mauritius with them. We had a health issue before boarding on Saturday evening. Air Seychelles off-boarded us, quite rudely, for a slight nausea my sister was having, ensuring us they'll put us on the next available flight and have someone at the airport to guide us with the procedures. Nobody. when we got off - So I got home.Next day, I called Expedia. They say can't take any liability. That the system says we did not show up.So I had to call Air Seychelles, get everything sorted out with them, except that Air Seychelles cant issue me new tickets.- It's Expedia's responsibility. I've been sent to and fro between the Airline and Expedia  through half a day. Yes !!! 4 hours.Horrible experience, customer care staff is good only at giving out phrases like "" I understand your frustration"" , ""I'll try to do anything I can to assist you"", but truly are lethargic and incapable of doing anything. I still am dealing between the services, they take ages and are truly useless at resolving anything.A couple of times Air Seychelles opened the system for tickets to be issued by Expedia.  They took so long that tickets were gone!!!!Update1. Sunday 25/07: 30 minutes they sent liability to Air Seychelles when the job was theirs2. Monday 25/07 : 4 hours on phone with them. Nada. 3. Tuesday 26/07: Nearly the half a day with them. Charged me ?500 to re-issue the tickets- Not only are they inefficient, but a bunch of thieves as well.Stay well away from them!!!!!!!Comment says issue has been resolved- but not really- They still charged me ?500, not informing me that this is charged automatically on the card with which I made the first payment (which I found unacceptable). The only thing is I managed to go on Holiday, though they managed to ruin the excitement of it before it even started.Avoid !!!!23rd August 2016 Update: - OK -  OK - they forked out all that money from me. The flight I took was supposed to have fabulous Nectar points AND loyalty scheme points that go with it ( Fly Blue for my case). You must have guessed it by now- Epic fail on that side too!!!!No Fly Blue Points- and no nectar either."

Expedia have lost a loyal customer in me
","Despite having small issues we ignore everytime, my wife and i always use Expedia to book our holidays. However, this time round the experience was unnacceptable and the response from Expedia shameful. We booked a holiday package to Marrakech for 2 adults and our 1 year old baby. Gave the package details and the names etc. Get to the airport and find out our baby hasn't been booked on (i quote ""another Expedia special"" said the lady at the desk). If we had booked this ourselves online this could be understood and we would take full responsibility, however, this was done over the phone and we gave our baby's name and date of birth. This resulted in us almost missing the flight, running around the airport trying to get our baby booked on, all the while our baby crying for a feed and a nappy change. Finally managed to get on board but my wife and i had to sit seperately, which was awkward and distressing for her as she breastfeeds. Our baby was put on the airport transfers list which made it all the more amazing as to how they missed her ticket booking! Upon returning and writing a post-trip complaint i recieved one phone call while at work (morning, not even during lunch hours where i could've picked up). A voicemail saying we would recieve an email response to our complaint and then nothing - silence from Expedia since. I have sent 3 follow-up emails and even resubmitted the complaint form and yet nothing apart from their automated response emails.Itinerary Number: 111845543796Had to post the review again as the website wouldn't let me reply to your response."

Shocking customer service....beware, never again will i book with Expedia. You deserve no stars
","Expedia Itinerary No.7197781985590Expedia you know very well why you are getting this very poor review. I won't go into detail but as you know I can edit this review at anytime to reflect the customer service i have not received.I have done everything myself, made all the calls abroad, finally sorted the airlines and checked the hotel. I haven't even departed yet so we shall see how the trip turns out in the end.You have done absolutely nothing to help to sort out the mess you made with this booking, so all you need to do is refund as agreed (after a lengthy battle) on your recorded telephone conversations with me still being pleasant and civil without delay the costs incurred. Your customer service is frankly ****I have had as yet no email confirmations of several that were promised of what you agreed so now you have a chance to reply on this website for all to see your assurance (as agreed) that you will again (as agreed) refund me the extra costs incurred due to errors in the initial booking by your call centre staff.So lets see how long it takes.... one week on, to date no emails, many calls, on hold and one on hold for over 1 hour, no return calls....nothing :(Note: I feel sorry for your call centre employees who I believe have their hands tied behind their backs and are unable by company policy to give the good customer service they know we deserve, it must be so frustrating for them. The initial mistake was made by them but I think the information available was poor which was the reason, so this criticism is directed at higher level management in the company.>>Sunday 24th July late evening after you called me and left voicemailThank you for calling. Why is it that the media team can call back straight away and yet Expedia customer service have still have failed to call or email. Could you not have got them to call me instead, sent the email or just done the refund I requested?. No because that's the common sense approach which Expedia don't do.Also it would have been helpful to leave a telephone number on the voicemail for me to call you back! You can call me again anytime after 8am but this time if I'm busy on another call please leave a direct line number on the voicemail so I can call back!!!>>Monday 25th July 9.50pmExpedia...after another hour on the phone going through the same details again and again this afternoon we are no closer to resolving my complaint and getting my refund.Now you say you are not getting my emails just like I'm not getting yours.

Lied to and fobbed off by Expedia
","Having a terrible time with Expedia currently!!!I made a flight and hotel booking with them for Thailand online, all went through smoothly or so I thought, payment went through and received confirmation email with all correct details.I then went on to the British Airways website to reserve my seats only to notice that my name on the flight reservation is in the wrong order, they have my middle name as my first name and vica versa which is clearly an issue as this will prevent me travelling. I have spoken to Expedia 3 times now all they keep saying is your name on the intinerary is correct but do not seem to understand that it is not correct on the flight ticket. It is clear I input my name correctly as it shows on the Expedia confirmation correctly but it seems to have got lost in translation onto the British Airways ticketing system.I escalated with Expedia and the social media team picked it up, they called me and told me that they have spoken to British Airways and this was due to a system glitch at the BA end and that all was fine, advised me not to check in online as my name is in the wrong order but if I check in at the airport there will be no problem. Clearly this does not sound right to me and did not fill me with confidence. I have spoken to BA directly and after a few calls there and back they advise that the reason my name is in the wrong order is that the Expdia booking system did not put my title in as Mr so the BA system has picked up my middle name as my title! Go figure, and that the only peoople that can correct it is the booking agent and that if it is not corrected I will be refused travel as my name does not match my passport.Expedia have blatantly lied to me and were quite happy for me to attenpt to travel with incorrect documents, such an appalling service when all they needed to do was change the name on my eticket.

Absolutely terrible service
",I booked a special trip for a surprise. I couldn't find direct flights on line so called Expedia and spoke to Khartik on the 17/7. I also was looking at excursions and he lied saying they would be cheaper to book through him. I asked for specific days however he said there was no need as they were valid for the duration of my trip wrong another lie. He then proceeded to book 2 trips on the same day for the same time on a day I was flying into Rome at a time that I was in the air and not even in the country never mind to places at the same time! I only knew this when I was sent the confirmation not what he promised. When I called Expedia I was left to tears of frustration as Dham and then Veejay both so called managers refused to amend the mistake until they'd listened to the call. After many hours of arguing they eventually agreed to email the vendor and promised to call me tonight as you guessed NO CALL. Then on top of everything the shuttle I booked with imbecile Khartik emailed me yesterday directly to advise me that Expedia had missed all my details from the booking. I was then subjected to another call yesterday to get you to put this right. The lady I spoke to put that right and said you'd received confirmation that the bookings had been amended. She also submitted a second complaint. Then today the excursion company emailed me and told me they were confused as they had 5 bookings for me and could I let them know the correct dates and times again Expedia made a very big mistake which I've had to again amend myself.I'm also upset as the excursion company very kindly moved the Vatican trip to 9am as Khartik couldn't be bothered to tell me when I was worrying how far the Vatican was and thought I'd need time to get there that my accommodation was actually only 300 yards from the Vatican entrance. I have therefore lost money as the 9am tour is ?20 cheaper.I am disgusted with Expedia and the way they have handled their mistake or the lack of handling it.I have had no communication or apology.I will never book with them again and that Khartik should be sacked what should have been a happy time has been a nightmare

Misleading and unacceptable
",Booked a hotel via a cashback referral site. Cashback tracked in account for a couple of months before my stay and for five months after then all of a sudden was removed from my cashback account with no explanation. Contacted cashback site to be told Expedia would not investigate they only investigate claims three months after a stay. So they had basically denied cashback with no explanation but wouldn't investigate due to their own self imposed deadlines.Pushed with cashback site only to be told months later after lots and lots of correspondence that Expedia had denied the cashback due to not being the last referral before purchase which isn't true. I'm still chasing the payment now over a year after my booking. An absolute shambles. Avoid.

Botched Car Rental
","Initially I lost the total costs of a botched car rental.I originally contacted Expedia customer services through Twitter and didn't get anywhere, so then phoned their main phone number.  This connects through to a typical low-quality Indian call centre.  I find these battery-chicken style call centres indefensible, they have no authority to do anything, they're sometimes scripted (thankfully Expedia's isn't), they have restricted access to your information, they usually ask you to recite your problem from the beginning every time, have little sympathy for your problem and in this case they had no knowledge of who Thrifty (the vehicle rental provider) were or any information to contact them.  Most UK based companies now understand that customer services is one of the most important part of a business and cannot be off-shored if you want your customers to have a good experience... and if you're having to ring customer support, you're probably looking to resolve a problem, not compound it further.After 4 or 5 calls, waiting 3 weeks and getting nowhere, I had no option but to leave a review here to explain my frustrations and hopefully help others.However I've since been contacted by Expedia UK, who have refunded the majority of my lost money and given me a ?50 Expedia voucher.Although this resolves my issue to my satisfaction (I've updated this review to 3 stars to reflect this), it took a review on TrustPilot to get any valuable level of customer support from Expedia and it still leaves the problem that allows future people booking vehicles from Thrifty via the Expedia website open to the Thrifty policy problem.  Thrifty have mechanisms in place to stop this fiasco happening if you book directly with them, so the issue that needs resolving is still with Expedia."

","Currently on the phone to Expedia Refunds Department over in India. It's been 2 hours since the first call was placed. We have spoken to 3 Customer Service guys, been hung up on twice and still there is no Manager in the building to help us cancel a flight. Only have till 6pm and then the 24 hours cancellation period ends, but it's ok - the Manager will ring us back tomorrow!!!! Expedia Customer Service has been the worst I have ever dealt with. If British Airways confirm the booking is fine to be cancelled then what is the problem! We have been quoted over and over again terms from a refund policy that is completely different to the one in the T&Cs from the booking. It seems they want to put this cancellation off until the 24 hours is up and then they won't have to give us a full refund. No one in this 5 person party will ever be using Expedia for bookings again. Why create problem layers by using Expedia when you can just book direct with the Airline!"

9 into 5 won't go!!!
","Booked a 9 seater mini bus from Expedia for Berlin Tegal airport. Had a funny feeling that they would not get it right. I checked direct with the provider Hertz in Berlin and was told that Expedia actually booked a 5 seater. Trying to get this rectified was a nightmare!!!!! I sent numerous emails and made many calls to customer services which is an Indian call centre. They would not accept that they had made a mistake and the vehicle which they booked (Ford S-max) was not adequate. I spent a lot of money on phone calls to Germany in order to prove to them that they had made a mistake and that the vehicle could no way accommodate the number of passengers I required it to. Finally I would not take no for an answer until I had spoken to a manager. After many heated exchanges (most of them on my part I admit) he told me that Expedia would refund my original booking fee and pay for an alternative booking with another agent. The problem here was that it was only 2 days prior to the start date of the hire and the vehicle I required (9 seater automatic) was very thin on the ground. I anticipated further problems from Expedia and requested they put in writing via email their promise to pay the cost of an alternative booking. To cut a long story short I found an alternative vehicle through Hertz. I have forwarded the invoice to Expedia via email and guess what? They continually fail to pay the invoice despite repeated requests. After all the trouble I have had with this company, I should have seen it coming. I would like to warn anyone thinking about using this Expedia to think very hard and use someone else. I was travelling with wheelchair assistance passengers and it would have been a nightmare arriving at Tegal airport and finding that my hire vehicle was a 5 seater! I took 2 days off from work to source an alternative vehicle and had to make direct calls to local hire companies in Germany. Furthermore, Expedia have not honoured their promise to pay for alternative hire. Avoid or book at your peril!!!!!!--------------------------------------------Further to this review, Expedia have taken very swift action indeed and remedied the problem by refunding the difference as they promised. Thank you for your response.Chris..............................................Update 13/05/2017I have since used this company on 3 other occasions and they have been fine. In view of this I would recommend and take my earlier experience as a glitch.............................................."

A complete joke of a company - Buyer beware
","Ok so here goes...Me & my partner get married next week we booked hotel & flights to Paris to a lovely hotel,, going great so far.. 8 days later the money for the hotel appears back in my bank account.. We ring Expedia to query after calling our bank who say expedia hasn't claimed the money which resulted in an expired transaction. After 8 hours of phone calls they agreed to rebook and compensate ?100 for their failings to be added as credit to be used for anything. A few days later we deciding to book some activities in Paris for when we arrived, only to find out we couldn't use the voucher!! Had to call the awful customer services team yet again, another 6 hours and getting nowhere finally someone from expedia called us back from their resolutions team. She agreed to pay the ?100 as cash back to my debit card. Problem solved or so we thought.... Later that day, my lung collapsed from the exasperation of having to deal with all the stress Expedia has put on to me in dealing with their incompetence.. I called today 15th July to cancel the booking on the basis of medical grounds since my lung has collapsed, sent medical certificate as proof of condition....Wait for it... Expedia has refused to refund the booking! Absolutely dismayed at the experience and the service we have received ever since using Expedia!! Customer services are not intrested in helping you, they are rude, put the phone down on you and make the situation 100 times worse which cause serious health implication, then they wash their hands of you when your unable to travel..!!!! I will never use expedia ever again and will be going to the media to ensure that others are aware of our experience so that they can avoid receiving the same treatment!

initially bad experience with a booking, resolved later
","I posted a similar review also on hotels.com , as they pass on the bookings to Expedia, who were the ones who dealt with my booking.   i recently booked a double room with them in Majorca for 2 people. However, they sent the hotel the confirmation about a double room for 1 person, not for 2!! When we came to check in the hotel, it was Sunday evening and we were forced to pay ?50 extra for an extra person in the room, despite the amount i paid online was for 2 people. The hotel refused to give us a room unless we paid up. Next morning we called the spanish Expedia office, they made all the excuses not to return the money and in the end when i asked to speak to the manager, the agent on the phone said the manager is away, then that their net access was down and that manager will not be able to call me back nor email me. The phone went dead several times when i asked questions. ????? On return to the UK i called the english Expedia office, hoping they will resolve the matter. The man on the phone said he would call the hotel, and never called me back. So simply they completely ignore me. Bad customer service(at least in the European offices i called)!p.s. replying to Expedia reply - my confirmation number was 130787798030     . what i put in search engine , checked before paying and  paid for was 1 night, bed and breakfast, no frills/nothing special room for 2 people (?115.86) . confirmation i got was for 1 person ,1 double room. therefore we got charged  extra 52 euros (around 49?)more (??) by the hotel (hotel was blaming travel agent for that) despite the hotel's rate for 2 people is around 130 euros. any justice?***UPDATE**** - i upgraded my rating to 3 stars,simply because the matter is resolved now thanks to the escalations office based in Americas. (why was there no will to resolve it with the English or Spanish offices which i called, no idea). Special thanks to Ankan from the escalations office, who contacted me and was very efficient in resolving the matter!! Expedia should employ more people like this gentleman!"

Carefull when paying, I was charged TWICE
","When paying for my Expedia.co.uk booking I was charged twice, When I realised that this had happened I called customer services and then spent over an hour on the phone to someone who could not, would not and didn't help.  I requested that a manager call me back and was told this could be anytime within a 72 hour period. When the manager did call, I missed the call but did not receive a voicemail message or an attempt to call again form this Manager, what I did receive was an email saying that as I had not answered the call the ?25 offer of a gift voucher was the end of the matter.I spent over an hour on the telephone to the customer service department, most of which was on hold.I was offered a ?25 gift voucher as a ""good will gesture"", not as compensation.I had to wait 3 days for the money to be returned to my bank.Confidence in paying is extremely important and I now have lost that confidence in Expedia and am extremely disappointed at how they dealt with my issues.itinerary # 112490752237Still waiting for Expedia to respond!!"

Best Price Guarantee
","This is the second time I have written about Expedia and the 'Price Guarantee'.  The first time I complained it was all due to emails not being received.  So I changed my score with them to 5 stars as the flights, hotel and transfers were brilliant on the first occasion.  Well believe it or not it has happened again.  I booked a hotel, flights and transfers with Expedia.  I again found it cheaper on another website.  I duly filled in the form on their Price Guarantee page and sent a screenshot of the cheaper holiday.  I was within the 48 hours they give you so thought all would go through.  Some 4 emails later, not once have they replied to me, I still have not received the difference in the holiday price.  I will seriously think about booking through them again.  There is a problem somewhere in that organisation and it is not good. If anyone from Expedia reads this review my Itinerary Number is 7240526082685.  This was booked over two weeks ago.I have today had a reply from Expedia a lovely gentleman called Rohan, who actually dealt with my complaint last year, was very helpful.  He managed to sort everything out for me, even though we still have a problem with the receiving of emails on both sides.  He was patient, as I am not tech savvy, with me sending copies of paperwork needed to show the price difference.  Expedia have honoured the price difference again and all I can say is that for me they have been brilliant.  Thank you Rohan."

Worst experience
","I booked 3 airline tickets for me wife and our little boy from Birmingham to bangalore via Dubai in Emirates in April 2016 for a travel in July. 4 days before the travel I realised there is a spelling mistake in my surname. Actually one letter was missing. I called the agent who said he will sort it out within few hours. Then on I kept calling them twice daily as I was panicking. It was a different agent every time and explain the same story. The flight was on Monday. On Sunday when I called again they would take the details again and put me on hold and never come back. Finally the 6 th person said my ticket is cancelled as the airlines can not provide any seat. I asked them what happened to my original reservation. They said that is cancelled asvavpartvofvname correction. I calked the emirates they said they cannot do anything it had come through the agent. Finally one agent said they cannot do name correction 4 prior to departure and it was my fault and they will refund money as per the cancellation policy. I said I never asked for cancellation. It looks like the the first agent had messed it ip and others were  probably trying to correct it. But I still cannot understand why they found it so difficult. Overall worse service. One agent even took sadistic pleasure if putting me on hold for 56 minutes and then said some one call. God bless them.Please don't book tickets through them to save few pounds it's not worth it.I am updating this review today, 25th October 2016. I contacted expedia over the phone many times. They said there is internal investigation going on about this. There was a mistake on their part. They offered a generous 100 pounds voucher as well!! but would take the cancellation charges. I asked the person to send this writing by an email. He said yes and as expected he never did. They are a bunch of liars who will say whatever they feel like to misguide you but dont take any responsibilities and never put anything in writing. This is a pattern. As of today I am still waiting to get my money back. Their website says 8-12 weeks but its been 15 weeks now. No money. I dont know where to complain against them. Any suggestions appreciated.

Many problems, Call Centre Doesn't Understand Customer Service!
","Problem 1)Tried to book a holiday (Hotel, Flight + Car) on the website, but each time I went to pay it said the price had changed and I needed to re-enter the passenger this happened 4 timesI then phoned up customer service and this turned into problem 2)I explained Problem 1) to the customer service agent and asked them to replicate the itinerary and gave them the itinerary number for the price quoted on when I first tried to book the holiday.The agent proceeded to book the hotel and flight and then gave me an inflated price.I said no I want the whole package flight exactly the same as the itinerary, hotel and car for the price quoted but I couldn't buy as the website wasn't allowing me too.The agent then told me he could get it all for ?15 less than my original quote. I agreed to this.Problem 3)When my itinerary came through I realised the agent had booked me a local car hire company and not Hertz (which was on my original itinerary).Problem 4)I phoned back customer and spoke to another agent I told him the problem he said he could get me a Hertz car for another c?200. I said no, I wanted the original package for the original price. He said he was unable to do that.Problem 5)I said ok, then please cancel my entire booking, the agent said that if I did that I would loose 100% of my money on the flight and hotel (a significant amount of money)By this time I was getting very angry. I asked to speak to the manager.Problem 5)The agent put me on hold for a few minutes and then gave me an excuse that the manager was busy and that he would only tell me the same as he did. He said I could wait to speak to the manager but he didn't know how long it would take, probably a long time - meaning it would cost me a lot in telephone charges.Problem 6)The agent told me that if I paid for the Hertz car and then found through internal investigation that I was right they would refund me. Really what he meant was please give us a another c?200 and we won't do any internal investigation.At this point I cancelled my original hire car and hung up on the phone.Neve deal with these people, no idea about customer service and don't risk your money.Itinerary number: 112471228191"

a complete and utter shambles
","In August 2015 booked two rooms through Expedia to stay in Lyon, France for a weekend in June 2016. Later in the month Expedia rang me to tell me that the hotel could not honour the booking due to over-booking. They then would ring me on and off for 3 weeks offering me alternative accommodation usually in the night from the US. In the end, they got the picture that I had booked alternative accommodation directly.last weekend in Lyon, I was therefore surprised to see that my credit card had been charged E760 for the original cancelled reservation.The night-mare then started. Phone calls to Expedia France, US and weirdly to India with people who would put you on hold, not return your phone calls, not even bother to reply to your Customer service e-mails. Everytime you ring you have to explain the whole saga again resulting it hours of frustration.In the end the hotel took pity, acknowledged the mistake made by Expedia and a week later I have been re-imbursed. However still no call, response or reply from Expedia and I assume no apology forthcoming.Never Ever Again............."

Booking a holiday and disappointed on arrival
","Booked holiday in Fuerteventura,  Costa calma R2 Rio calma.  Booked sea view but no see to be seen from hotel room. Insisted to have room exchanged but second one even worse.  Answer on reception was... I should book my stay with different tour agent but not Expedia.  And if I did I would have better room and 2 free spa sessions.  Don't think will use Expedia again.  Didn't received what I paid for."

Useless when there's a problem.
","I booked a flight only via Expedia.  The online booking experience was fine and the price was good but ....What happens if something goes wrong?Answer: You're on your own!My EasyJet flight home from Italy (booked via Expedia) was cancelled.  When I tried to contact Expedia (online of course as no phone numbers were easily available) the clear answer was to contact the airline direct.  However, because I had booked through Expedia, my booking reference was not recognised by EasyJet, so I was unable to manage my booking online, which cause numerous problems and meant that I was pretty much bottom of the barrel when getting onto an alternative flight home.  My 79 year old mother and I had to wait over 48 hours in Italy before we could get on a flight home.  Also I received no notifications from Expedia about the cancellation.  I only found out because other holiday makers told me of the problems. I suggest using Expedia to search prices etc. but if you then decide to book a flight, go direct to the relevant airline, rather than booking via Expedia!ITINERARY NO: 111594965519"

Poor information given and awful customer serive
","Never booking with expedia again, don't give you all the relevant information you require prior to booking and awful, awful customer service to match. Nothing about definitely having to pay for baggage, and then phone up Lufthansa to say my type of ticket requires payment for luggage. Lufthansa also agreed that this is not the first time that Expedia have not given the correct information. Spent almost an hour on the phone to have my issue unresolved - even came to a compromise and asked for 1 luggage allowance even though there are two passengers. Why should a customer have to pay for something that they were not informed about at the time of booking?And the service - Laughing at a customer? I've never experienced such terrible terrible service and it's a joke. No one book with expedia. Minus stars if it could be given."

Avoid! Unprofessional Company! Useless customer service!
","A couple of weeks ago, I booked a return flight ticket from Copenhagen(CPH) to Istanbul Sabiha Airport(SAW) for August 2016 on Expedia.co.uk. My original plan was flying Copenhagen from London on Friday 29'th July, spending there the weekend with some close friends and flying Istanbul on the 1'st of August.On Monday last week I received a call along with an email saying that ""the airline company has cancelled your outbound flight to Istanbul on the 1'st of August because of operational reasons"". And I was told that the Airline Company had already issued me with another ticket for the 2'nd of August. This obviously changed everything! I can not stay in Copenhagen one more night since my friends are going away for a holiday as well; plus I have another booked flight to catch in Istanbul in the afternoon on 2'nd of August. So I have no other chance but to be in Istanbul on the 1'st of August, otherwise I have to change my entire travel plans!!!For the following days I contacted Expedia's Customer Service several times in order to finding a solution. Each time I called in I spent nearly an hour on the line and each time there was a different person on the other side of the line. So I had to go through my story over and over again with every single member of Expedia's Customer Service. After spending two days with Customer Service, I was finally told that Expedia can not do anything but refunding the ticket price! What a proseffioonal Company & its professional Customer Service Team! Like a joke! Seriously..Even though the Airline Company has several other direct flights from CPH to Isanbul on 1'st of August, I was kept told that there is no direct flight at all! I told Expedia that I was OK with arriving Istanbul Ataturk Airport which is not far from Istanbul Sabiha Airport.After all, Expedia kept saying there is nothing they can do as the Airline Company is not willing to offer me a ticket to Ataturk Airport. I was forced to either take the flight on the 2'nd of August or accept the refund. Flight tickets have doubled since the time I booked my ticket; staying in Copenhagen will cost me exstra; plus I have to cancel my folowing day flight within Turkey and purchase another ticket!!! A refund will obviously not compansate my lost and it seems like I'll have to cancel my original plans of staying over in Copenhagen and book a direct flight from London to Istanbul on the 1'st of August!!All in all, I can say that Expedia is far from defending it's customers' rights. They are there to work for their? business partners' benefits! They dont have any corporate or business values!; They have a very unprofessional way of dealing with issues!; And their Customer Service is useless!Don't book any holidays or flights on Expedia! Avoid! Be aware! They might? cancel your booking because of ""Operational Reasons""! And I can assure you that they will not even bother to explain what are these Operational reasons!! Avoid! Dont buy!"

No Baggage Allowance on BA Flight booked by Expedia
","I booked 2 outward flights to Florence from London City Airport and 2 single return flights from Rome with British Airways; our holiday was 1 week in Florence, travel by rail to Rome for second week then return home.   Outward journey was problem free but I received a totally unexpected shock when checking in at Rome FCO when I was told that I had zero baggage allowance and had to pay 65 euros for each bag I wished to check in.   I have flown BA many times and their Economy class includes 1 checked piece of luggage per passenger within the cost; how I ended up with zero allowance needs to be investigated.   My Expedia flight confirmation details only stated that the airline MAY charge for checked baggage but said nothing about a zero baggage allowance.   Totally unimpressed and will never use Expedia again."

Worst experience ever
","I have booked two business class tickets form London to Seoul and received conformation email at the same day. But when I arrived at airport, the airline staff said the tickets had already been cancelled. Because Expedia did not pay the money to them.  I have call my bank and they said the money has already been charged from my account. When I calling customer service of expidia, the officer try to help me get a new tickets. But there is no seats available at that time. My whole journey is delayed. I wake up at 6am in the morning to airport. And finally take a flight at 19:35.  It's a terrible experience ever. The ticket department should notice me early if they cannot get the tickets.   Hope everyone double confirm of the issue tikets, in case of same situation happened."

Never Again !
","A return flight from Luton to Waterford plus Hotel was booked  and paid for on 10th May to travel on 7th June, returning on 11th June.  Confirmation was received with the tag line ' Your reservation is booked and confirmed.. There is no need to call us to reconfirm this reservation '    I called less then 24 hours prior to departure to see if  i needed to print out a boarding pass, only to be told that the return flight had not been confirmed, and on checking was actually not available, nor could you book me onto any other flight and the best you could offer was cancellation. The person I spoke with gave his name as VAIGHAV. I requested a call from someone more senior to discuss this but so far without success.  An email has been received confirming cancellation of the hotel and the amount that will be refunded, but nothing so far about the flight out and the non existent return. . My granddaughter got to hear about this and posted her feelings on Twitter which resulted in a response and eventually a call from LUKE ROHIT which  told me that Expedia book seats and hotels and if the airline cancels then its not Expedia s fault and i should take it up with the airline. He seemed to find it amusing that i was less than satisfied with this response and was even conducting another conversation with someone else at the same time.I see from the considerable number of complaints that are posted onto this site that an Itinerary number is required.  Mine is11951645017DavidHad a phone call from Expedia today which was a waste of time as they confirmed they had credited back the money which I can confirm and stated that an email had been sent to advise of the cancellation of the return flight.

WHAT'S GOING ON WITH OUR TICKETS - 15/06/2016
","Girlfriend and I booked a trip to NYC booked to leave gatwick on June 15th. My girlfriend checked our itinerary etc online yesterday to be sure everything was in order, and as it turns out her ticket has been cancelled/""refunded"" (she has not received a refund or any correspondence about this, so refund is not the word to use, but thats what Expedia's employees have called it). Im sure you can imagine the panic this would cause less than a week before we're supposed to leave on this expensive holiday, so she called you immediately to find out. The phone operator that answered was not able to explain why the situation happened at all, but said she would ""get on it"" and get back within 24 hours, which would mean by today. She sent a bewildering and out of context email telling me girlfriend that ""refunds are not permitted"", with aboslutely no information as to the cause of this situation, and no help at all - the ticket was still missing.So girlfriend called up again, spoke to someone else. This person was also entirely unhelpful and said my girlfriend would have to buy a NEW ticket for the full ?870. When my girlfriend fairly refused, as this is entirely Expedia's fault and it is appalling behavior to request that we buy another ticket after they seemed to have ""lost"" our current one, and did not reimburse us, the phone operator said she would get her manager to call back in half an hour. The manager did not call back. So we called again. Was on hold for 3 hours to speak to the manager, who in turn was no help either. We have now been referred to the ""escalation"" team, who we are unable (apparently) to contact directly. Instead she was told that an email was sent to the team, and we would hear back in 72hours. 3days. And our flight leaves in 5days. This is absolutely disgusting customer servic. We have spent about 8 hours in contact with Expedia over the past 2 days and have received absolutely no information about our situation that can clarify.The airline said that the ticket was refunded (for no reason - we never requested it) and the money from said refund is now with Expedia, who refuse to do anything about it other than send an email that will take 3 days to process. We are still entirely in the dark with what is going on at Expedia, and whether we will even be able to go on this holiday, and it seems like all they are doing is bouncing our case around departments to be rid of it. This was my girlfriends 21st birthday celebration and its beginning to look like it will be entirely ruined. We need responses ASAP. This is not an okay way to conduct business. This needs to be sorted now. But reading the other reviews I get the sinking feeling we won't make it to NY, let alone see our money again. Still waiting to hear back.Itinerary number: 110690993501"

Took ?2000 out of my account!
","Cannot believe this company and regret reading reviews before attempting to book my holiday to Marrakech. After I had entered my payment details I kept getting a warning that my card details were not correct. So I tried another card which was linked to the same account but the same warning about my card details came up again. I then checked my emails to see if anything had come through however there was no confirmation for any holiday. I called the bank up and they said that Expedia had taken four lots of ?485 out of my account (?1940) and I had to get in contact with them in order to get a refund.I was on the phone to Expedia for way over an hour trying to speak to the right person. Not to mention the first person hanged up on me! When I had finally got the chance to speak to someone they blamed this issue on EasyJet.. even though the money was taken out by Expedia?! The employee told me that this had happened a lot and they would refund me in 72 hours. He advised me to book another holiday separately which meant booking the hotel on Expedia and flights on the EasyJet site. I then asked him if he was able to book the holiday again for me with the money I was going to be refunded however he said it would probably happen again. I made him aware that booking the two separately would cost me over double the price I was originally suppose to pay and he responded ""correct"". I've never engaged myself in a company that had no sympathy for making such a big mistake and providing no solution to make it up to me. I now have to patiently wait for my money to be refunded so that I can book my holiday again. Not to mention that my holiday was only suppose to cost ?780 so I have no idea where they got the ?485 or ?1940 from."

Awful, awful, awful...without a doubt the worst customer service
","Expedia made a duplicate/triplicate booking for our family holiday to Sri Lanka charging us over ?2600 twice and putting  a further pre-authorisation on our account for another ?2000 - amounting to ?7200 for a ?2,600 holiday. Some 15 telephone calls later and over 16 hours of calls over a three week period we still do not have the full refund. Every time we call, we have to repeat the information regarding the duplicate booking only to be told that it is our fault (its not, they made the booking over the telephone for us), that the money has not been taken (it has and I had to produce my bank statements to prove it), and that it will take up to 12 weeks to refund the air tickets and 3 days to refund the hotel. We are continually lied to about refunds having been authorised only to find that they have not been. We have now been refunded for the hotel (over two weeks late) although to add insult to injury they decided not to refund it in total, keeping ?15, I can only assume for costs purposes. This, despite it being their fault. The airline tickets remain outstanding and we should expect them to take up to 12 weeks to refund the remainder of the money to our account. This is money that they have taken and which will not be returned to us for up to 3 months leaving us struggling to pay our monthly bills.  Be very, very careful of booking with this company. If you have an alternative way of booking that costs you a few extra pounds, do it. I estimate that this problem has cost my husband and I over ?500 in lost working hours dealing with it, and in ancillary expenses like phone calls and securing alternative finances whilst we wait for the refund...and it is still ongoing..................................................................................................................Dear MIn response to your reply.

Expedia Booked hotel they don't even deal with!
","I booked 4 single rooms for 2 nights in Blackpool in April for me and 3 of my friends.  I received confirmation from Expedia about this and even installed their app to track my booking.  Our party arrived at the Henson Hotel to book in at 2 o'clock on 28th May to be told that the Henson Hotel doesn't deal with Expedia at all and there were no bookings under my name either.  No rooms had been reserved and the hotel was fully booked.  This left us in a huge quandary.  I called Expedia from the lobby of the hotel, the Expedia rep on the line asked to speak to the hotel contact who confirmed that they do not deal with Expedia, there were no reservations made for my party and they were also fully booked.  I was then placed on hold for 20 minutes until Expedia disconnected me.I called back, went through the same rigmarole with another rep just to be placed on hold again.  Again after 20 minutes I was disconnected from the Expedia end.I was then called back from Expedia who then promptly placed me on hold for 40 minutes!By this time it was nearing 4 o'clock and we had to find somewhere to sleep.  However this was a bank holiday and Blackpool was pretty much booked up; especially when looking for 4 single rooms.  In the end we had to settle for a 3 person bedroom with one of us on the floor!  We couldn't find a booking for the second night and had to come home.This was a shambles.  Our weekend away was cut short and completely ruined by the utter ineptitude of Expedia.  It cost us more money for an unsuitable room we had to find ourselves with no help from Expedia at all."

Seems impossible to get a refund for cancelled flights, charged ridiculous amounts for calls to premium numbers
","***Update 2nd June***After waiting over 8 weeks for a refund, I contacted the airline who Expedia say have my money. The airline informed me that Expedia have the money as the airline processes refunds in 3-5 working days, not the 2-12weeks that Expedia claim. I was advised to consider using the small claims court or at least contact the Airline Ombudsman. So it seems Expedia are lying and hanging onto the money for as long as possible, blaming any hold ups on the airline who have already transferred the funds. As usual, Expedia hold the party line, refuse to even look into what is going on and continue to repeat '2-12 weeks, it's the airline's fault' ad infinitum...Flights booked and paid for in full on 26th February, and additional cancellation insurance purchased. A week before the flights are scheduled the times are changed completely. A voice message is left for me with no detail other than 'call this number'. The number begins 0207 for a national rate call to London. It is impossible to get an answer from this number in less than 30 mins. So far I've had to call 9 times, totalling 6 hours. During the second call I was told explicitly that 'the airline has issued a refund'. Despite this I am still waiting for this to be credited to my account 5 months after paying for the flights. Each person I speak to simply says 'it can take 12 weeks' with no other explanation.To top it all, I discovered this morning that the 0207 number I was asked to call is diverted to a premium rate line and I've been charged ?33.48. Net result of dealing with Expedia?1. Still waiting for ?498 to be refunded for flights which were useless to me because the times were changed. 2. There is no way to find out when this money will be returned without spending at least 45 mins on a premium rate line to someone who gives no information beyond 'wait for 12 weeks and if you don't receive a refund call back'3. 6 hours wasted on phone calls which have cost ?33.48Net gain by Expedia??531.48 in the bank for providing no service whatsoever beyond paying below living wage to someone in India to read pre-prepared statements from a card for 6 hours.***UPDATED***Posting on this forum gets your issue immediately under the noses of the 'escalation' team, who called within a couple of hours of this post. The only thing they succeeded in escalating was my level of exasperation.A completely pointless call as the person tried to justify not refunding the money by saying behind the scenes the money is transferred to the airline rather than Expedia. As far as I'm concerned, and legally under consumer law, my contract is with Expedia and not the airline. If I book a flight through Expedia then I expect Expedia to deal with anything arising from it. They are happy to take the booking and the money, so I fail to understand why they do not refund it if they cancel the booking.The person told me exactly the same story that transpired in the other 9 phone calls - nothing had changed, I still have to wait an arbitrary amount of time which could be up to 12 weeks, and if I don't get the refund call them back on the premium rate number. Regarding the premium rate call charges, they will only investigate if I supply full copies of my itemised phone bills with details of every number I've called, when I called it, and how long for, for the last three months...A complete and utter waste of my time and that of the Expedia representative. I could actually hear embarrassment in his voice as he repeated the same tired lines."

Expedia and its partner in Florence spoiled our trip
","We decided to go to Florence for my child?s birthday. I booked my bed and breakfast on expedia.co.uk for three nights.  I made full payment of 324.00 EURO for two adults and one child. I received an itinerary confirmation from expedia .co.uk. We arrived at B&B, called La Terrazza Su Boboli, on 2 April 2016 as planned. The Owner of B&B said that our reservation was  cancelled. I called Expedia. An Expedia representative confirmed that our reservation had been cancelled and he didn?t explain why, but said that he would request an  investigation. He also ensured me that I didn?t need to worry as he reopened the booking so that we could stay at the B&B. He therefore wanted to talk to the owner of B&B. The owner refused to talk to Expedia. She said ?she has nothing to do with expedia.?  Eventually, someone from the B&B talked to expedia and told the representative that  the B&B is fully booked and there is no available room for us. After the phone call, the owner said if we booked directly from them  (B&B), we could stay. The owner also said that we had to pay 399.00 Euro instead of 324 EURO . We had no choice so we accepted whatever the owner asked and we stayed at the B&B, La Terrazza Su Boboli.Itinerary no: 7161052573071"

?20k Money taken with no holiday booking!
","I attempted to book a holiday to Barcelona through Expedia on 12th May.  The booking was not successful and the message advised to try again shortly and if not successful to search again and change flights.  Which I did. Continual failure and three different cards tried i gave up and tried again the following day.  Still no luck so found an alternative company and booked through them.  A few days later I was unable to use my credit card and called my bank only to be told that Expedia have taken 20 payments from my card which has maxed out my credit limit!! In total they have taken over ?20,000 for holidays that I haven't even been able to book!!!I have called them several times, wasted nearly two hours explaining this issue and being assured that the money is being returned (it has not), called yesterday to be told that a FAX has been sent to Barclays!! I don't even bank with Barclays!!! I have since been promised ?200 compensation and a reference number with no instruction on how to claim it or process it:""This is to confirm that ,there was an pre authorization taken on your card for 20,000/- GBP and we have sent an fax to your bank on 18th of May to release it, and it takes 72hrs to release the hold on your card.please be able to check with your bank if they have received an fax from us, so that we can take further actions.And I Apologize for the inconvenience ,we understand that it is been a trouble but we will try resolving at earliest.And also we will be giving you 200GBP refund as a good will and inconvenience occurred, please provide the reference number S-122915686..""My email reply has been ignored and I still do not have the preauthorised ?20,000 returned to my account!! Disgusting behaviour, terrible customer service, awful email and I would strongly advise that you avoid using Expedia - that cheaper price will end up costing you in the long run!!If anyone from Expedia can be bothered to look into this the itinery number is 7182961505188 and the case id is REQ:S-122915436"

Glitch in the system
","I have recently booked a holiday to Morroco in September with Expedia. When booking the hotel, I chose one of the more expensive rooms instead of the basic room as it had a shared private pool which is what attracted us to the hotel. Upon recovering my booking confirmation I realised that although I had been charged the extra money for the upgraded room, my itinerary stated that I had only booked the basic room. When I called Expedia about this, they said they would look into it for me, and if I could replicate this glitch again and screen shot the evidence, then they would give me the room I had paid for, and Expedia would be at fault. I was able to recreate the fault and as instructed screen shotted the evidence and sent it to them with a detailed explanation of what was happening in each screen shot. After trying to replicate the booking several times, it seems to only happen about half of the time. The reply I got to this email was that there was no glitch and it was my fault. It was as if they hadn't even looked at the evidence that I had provided. They are now supposed to be looking into this again and have asked that I send a copy of my bank statement so they can look at the prices for that day. I am not confident at all that this will be resolved without us having to pay extra for the room that we have already paid for! Very disappointed with Expedia and their service.My issue has now been sorted and my upgrade has been given to me at no extra cost. Thank you for your time Rohan."

Mixed.
","I had a fairly good experience apart from a car I'd booked which never showed up. I ended up getting a train but upon returning I have contacted Expedia 3 times asking about a refund for the car. First call got nowhere, the second I was asked to email and that email has never even been acknowledged.Not sure I'd use again even though they were okay for flights and hotels, they appear to offer no service at all out side of the bookings.Updated with itinerary number as requested. 110564842582EDIT: As you can now see, my refund has been issued. It's not ideal to have to come onto a third party site to get issues resolved but at least they were quick to do so once I did. I will reiterate that the hotel and flights, which is the main part, were both trouble free and great so I'm changing my review to 4 stars now. Just be wary of booking cars, I suspect it was the car service rather than Expedia who were at fault for this.Overall, I would recommend Expedia for good deals on flights and hotels but be sure of what you want and maybe avoid extras like shuttles from airports."

Unable to get refund
","I have booked a number of holidays and hotels in the past with expedia.co.uk but never again. I was incorrectly charged a credit card fee when using a debit card back in February 2016 after numerous emails stating I would get my refund in 5-7 days I still have not received the refund 3 months later. Customer services just keep giving me the same old cut and paste answer but never actually do what they say.18/05/2016As requested 111035566395 this is being dealt with under case number  REQ:M-12762472.22/05/2016After dealing with customer service for nearly 3 months this was sorted in a day with the help of the guy on the escalation desk (a big thank you to Mani). To Expedia Management - you need to sort out the service provided by customer service. The escalation desk dealt with this in a day, showing it is possible BUT to get to them I had to write a bad review on Trust Pilot. I had repeatedly asked in my emails for the issue to be escalated but these were just ignored."

False advertising!
","I'm really disappointed with Expedia.  I booked some flights last week (itinerary 111940734891), quite quickly after having seen the message ""only 7 tickets left at this price"", only to find that less than 48 hours later, the price has dropped ?400!  Again the same message on that flight ""only 7 tickets left at this price"".  Called customer services and no help.  I can understand that they may not be able to refund me the difference, but even credit towards hotel bookings would have been a decent gesture of goodwill.I doubt I will use Expedia again, beware of not falling into the trap of booking quickly because they are saying ""only x tickets left at this price""."

inconvenience . false promises
",I booked a trip to Luqa via Expedia I was informed that the booking had been completed. then few days later I was informed that I had to rebook through Ryan Air has the booking was not done. I was told that they would pay the difference. I rang and was put on hold for quite awhile. I was promised a voucher for ?25 as a good will gesture to book later. I told them that it was unlikely that I would have another holiday within the year. The voucher had not finalised I rang again as it was a matter of principal if they promised me it it should be granted. I was informed that they would do it straight away. Again I rang and was on phone 45 mins .12 days later  (time I do not have to waste) eventually  the manager did process the voucher.. It has not a good start to the holiday booking.  Expedia are supposed to be a reputable company. They did not do as promised without 3 long calls. the voucher is of no value to me      .I had 2 vouchers for ?25 and ?50 I was informed last year that I could get ?75 off next booking for hotel or flight etc. I was not informed that I could only use 1 voucher for each booking. I spent 45mins on phone to make a booking. The advisor stated that I had to use the vouchers before June. I will be unable to use it as having a baby in May. The advisor stated was unable to help. So the ?25 voucher is off no use to me. It is a matter of principal. I should have been informed initially . He then tried to say that vat was not included in the booking etc. Again nothing was mentioned previously. Expedia are supposed to be a reputable company yet they do not care about their customers.

Expedia Payment System has a massive software bug- glitch

Expedia will continue asking you to try again  and continue taking funds until your bank credit runs out or your bank contacts you to ask why the same value  transaction is repeatedly going through your account. According to bank a common Expedia problem.  Expedia Customer service  solution to problem -  ""booking not confirmed by us us so we don't understand the problem"".

I did all this many times and then got very stressed to then find out that my bank cards had been blocked as many payments had been taken but i had not been given any confirmation!! so expedia have my money and i have no holiday!!! i then have to speak to expedia to try and sort this issue out, and i still don't have a holiday booked.

When you think Expedia just STOP!
","An unauthorised trip was booked and money taken out of my account due to an error/issue with the Expedia website.  No email confirmation received and I was told not payment taken by their team.  ?800 pounds of of my account later I log into my Expedia account to see a trip booked.  After nearly two weeks of customer service and their media team wasting my time they have washed there hands of this complaint and said tough!I wanted to further the complaint and I was told customer last point of contact for high level complaints is Facebook????  That is how serious they take complaints, what a huge joke.  So if you ever need to change, cancel a trip or if Expedia just want randomly taken money out of your account you can count on one thing Expedia will not help.  It is a bad sign when customer care cannot read emails, do not understand what you are saying and you have to repeat yourself more than 5 times and even then the penny just doesn't quite drop.  Thieves, unhelpful and a total waste of hours off anyone's life."

Do not book with Expedia - terrible customer service
","I booked a dream trip to New York to celebrate my 40th birthday in November. It was a package deal of flight plus hotel and I paid in full. Less than a week later I discovered I was pregnant after trying for a baby for a considerable amount of time.  Obviously my husband and I were over the moon but since I would be due the week we fly we called Expedia to see if we could change the holiday. After several hours on the phone, conflicting information from the staff at Expedia and a lot of stress we changed the dates from November to June at a cost of almost ?500 which Expedia informed us was the airline cost to change the tickets, although the airline informed us it was Expedia making the charge! We did want to change the date to July, however Expedia informed us it was more expensive in July so would cost over a thousand pound extra. I did see the exact same holiday in July for same price we had paid in November but was informed these prices were only available to new bookings!!!  I was beginning to get very stressed over the whole thing and having previously suffered two miscarriages I paid the ?500 and changed to June. Last night whilst completing my esta, it came to light that the itinerary states my hotel is for November! I called Expedia who informed me only my flights have been changed, my hotel is booked for November! I booked it as a flight plus hotel deal. I clearly informed them I would be unable to fly in June so they changed the flights but not the hotel! Their explanation was that we might want to still stay at the hotel in November and unless I specially asked them to change the hotel they would not do so. Surely if you book a package deal then any changes should apply to the whole deal, and surely it is common sense that if you are flying to the us from the uk in June then you want your accommodation in June and not November! We now have to wait 72 hours so Expedia can listen to the tapes to see if we asked them to change the hotel. To be honest I don't know if I asked them to change the hotel, I spent over ten hours on the phone to Expedia over the course of four days, speaking to several different staff, whom all gave conflicting information about holiday changes so I cannot recall if I asked them if the hotel was changed. I do remember mentioning that I don't mind if our new room was not an ungraded one with a view of Times Square but they said the new holiday had to be the same terms as the last! If Expedia come back saying the hotel is staying as November our whole holiday will be cancelled as I don't have any money to book another hotel, so we will have lost ?3,200 plus another ?638 which we paid for booking tours and trips in advance.This company is a joke. Do not use them, trust me if anything goes wrong the customer service you receive will make you Ill.My ltinerary #11155629597392HOURS LATER AND I HAVE STILL NOT HEARD FROM EXPEDIA!!!Sancht from Expedia social network complains department has now called me and has sorted out this matter satisfactory.

I have checked my spam box and emails, NO NO NO All lies Expedia, do they think they can get away with saying this in todays day of technology? shame on you!! They said they had stated in the email I never got that they have sent me a good will gesture to use with them, and that the hotel do offer Spa Services, THEY DO not THE SPA is NOT build yet, as Novotel was only Built in October 2015 and they Spa Room was in March 2016, Just a shell, nothing there, not even walls! Novotel has admitted this to me and Expedia saying otherwise, hmmm I have been there in person, I think I know better then you! check online regarding Expedia customers services, shocking blogs from customer, one had so much abuse from Arizona call Centre they had to contact the police. Shocking CompanyReply - Expedia Requested Itinerary #111292714584 number for investigation, still NO Contact Despite fake Promises to resolve here!!! Novotel Contacted Me, Attitude towards me is Sorry, NO Spa/Steam/Sauna  until June 2016, Despite Expedia and the Hotel advertising it has these facilities!!! DO NOT BELIEVE EXPEDIA REPLY HERE AS THEY STILL DO NOT CONTACT YOU!!! HEAD OFFICE ADDRESS PLEASE EXPEDIA, as you don't ever contact me! I booked a Hotel with expedia which advertised the Hotel was 4Star with great facilities which was suppose to include Spa, Steam Room and JacuzziHotel Novotel did not have a Spa Room on the 5th Floor (still being build, Empty room just a shell where it was suppose to be) 6th Floor,Steam Room was half complete and not working and Jacuzzi did not exist.I contacted Expedia and she was apologetic and spoke to her supervisor because I said I will go to the press, They Promised they will speak to the hotel and recover the costs as it'ss unacceptable , so they will contact me within 28 days after sorting out all these issues with the hotel. SHOCK, HORROR, GASP! NO email, no response ever since the phone call on 31/03/2016 at 18:35, so now I have to advertise my disgust with the company on here, and soon on Facebook, Twitter, etc and will also be taking this further as this is Fraud to sell a service which I have paid for and not received. Expedia are clearly not bothered once they have your money and they do nothing as promised. I have used Expedia for years and always had problem with check-in but never had problem with false advertising before. The only good thing I can say, is they removed the Novotel fatalities from their website once I informed them that they had not even been build yet! Even the Hotel has information in your room telling you the Spa Rooms on the 5th, Steamroom on the 6th, when I asked Novotel Staff where it was, he laughed and pointed to an empty shell, I did not bother complaining as even at check-in I had nothing but problems and they even told me it was on 5th floor when I asked at check-in, Novotel and Expedia don't care once they have your CASH ??? , be warned!!! Expedia also owns, Hotels.com, Hotwire.com, trivago, Egencia, Venere.com,Travelocity, and Orbitz  so becareful if you don't want to use them again!!!!"

Comedy of errors
","My wife and I have over the course of the last few days spent hours on a the phone dealing with a litany of incompetence and poor service.Our ask was simple - we wanted to change one leg of a Turkish Airlines trip going SIN > IST > HEL / HEL > IST > SIN flight we booked last year, namely the outbound IST > HEL flight. Same flight, same times just move it forward a few days so we didn't have to stopover with out young family in what is now a somewhat risky location.It started with my wife calling last week, and being told there were no flight available on that leg on the Sat 18th June.I called back again a couple of days later to check, was told the same. I checked on the Turkish Airlines website and saw flights were available. I called back and mentioned this and was told to wait as maybe they didn't show in the expedia systems.I called back a day later, same response. I called Turkish airlines to check, they said there were a lot of seats available on that flight and to talk to expedia and if needs be have them call the airline direct. Eventually the agent understood the ask and called. He came back and agreed that there were in fact flights available. However he then quoted me $10,000 SGD for this flight for 4 people. A flight that costs ~$900 on turkish airlines website and also more than triple what we paid for the *entire* journey for 4 of us. This price was in economy FYI.I called back Turkish again, they were as surprised and said no this couldn't be the case. I called back your agent, eventually (And by now I've spent several hours on calls with incompetent agents) he agreed that in fact there was a cheaper priced fligth available. this one totalling ~$1700 SGD, still quite a lot more than the quoted fair, but not as ludicrous as his first quote. I told him to wait till I spoke to my wife before making changes and I would confirm the next day.Recieved a call the next day from an agent, told him we weren't sure now due to the price and to not make the changes. Seems the agent had jumped the gun and actually cancelled our original leg anyway, leaving us little choice but to go ahead and make the booking. Oh did I add that the price the day after had changed by ~$200 dollars. Nevertheless I agreed to pay, he confirmed the details and I believed, mistakenly, that we were done.Wrong, received an email later that day saying *ALL* our flights were now cancelled. Called again, spoke to an agent who confirmed this. He then started to suggest we'd have to pay fare differences and fees for flights we had already paid for and thought were booked. Obviously I took exception to this and eventually he reinstated my flights and finally I have a journey with all the flights requested, for $1656 extra (About $700 more than the advertised one way price on turkish airways website.This experience was truly dreadful, it was like some kind of awful comedy where you think the service can't get any worse and yet it does. The agents have no clue how to book a flight, change a flight, or check availability or even quote me a proper price. They don't even know what airport codes stand for or how to pronounce the cities we were flying to properly. I spent hours of my life on the phone dealing with this, my wife did also."

Terrible customer service. Never again.
","I have booked several trips with Expedia. It is fine, unless a problem arises. If it does, their service deteriorates to the point of being a disgrace to the industry. In February I booked a holiday for 5 in Crete. I wanted one particular property, on an exact date, with a particular flight time/airport. I paid in full and received confirmation. 2 months later, I received an email saying the property had been double booked and was no longer available. I was offered an alternative which was totally inappropriate (original one on the beach, new one 4 miles inland...hello???). After 2 days of calls to Expedia (and then the property owner) I reluctantly agreed to change my dates. This cost me ?200 (Easyjet admin charge). I also effectively lost a day of holiday as I had to move from an early morning to late evening flight. I never would have booked those times originally (travelling with children). I have phoned (?35 bill so far)and emailed Expedia so many times. Every time I get the '28 days' email....nobody phones back, ever. They even sent me an email in French (thanks!). Anybody reading this, do not book with these people. If ANYTHING goes wrong, you will be left out of pocket. In case anybody from Expedia is reading this, my Case number is 37765750 but, as you don't appear to give a monkey's c*%p about your customers, I don't suppose you will bother about this either!Well-interesting update. How can you not recognise the Case number I I was given in March when I made my complaint?? This just gets worse and worse. My original itinerary number was 111044408917, departure 1 Aug 2016. This is the reason why your customers become annoyed and why I am telling everyone about my rubbish experience.Another update.After 61 days  of silence, and 7 '28 day emails' (plus a French one), Expedia has suddenly sprung into life!5 calls to voicemail in one hour! You seem to have found my mobile number. Well how about refunding my ?200 to my credit card, which you obviously have the details for? I will be available on Wednesday 11 May, to discuss this if you need to but there really isn't anything to discuss. An email apologizing for your rubbish service and a refund should have been forthcoming weeks ago.Trustpilot readers....I will keep you updated.As promised, an update to my complaint. Credit where credit is due, I was contacted by Expedia this afternoon as I requested. Very polite man has refunded me my ?200 and apologized for the inconvenience and delay in resolving this issue. I have also been given compensation. I am still very annoyed about the original incident and Expedia's response to it. I am also still incredulous about the delay etc. However, I am grateful to this staff member for sorting it out."
392,"Hi Gillian, I'm sorry if you feel this way about Expedia. I understand your situation here and to be honest, we had no intentions of adding any stress to this.

Does anyone work in customer services or is it just stock e-mails replies!
","Ref: Complaint - REQ:M-12678951I raised a complaint about my stay following a hotel booking through this company. They failed to fulfil their part of the contract and I requested a refund.For 3 months I have been batted away by the stock 'please allow us 28 days to investigate' crap that many others seem to have suffered. It seems to be a common theme that this company attempt to stall you into a state of submission, well some of us don't let these things pass.I believe that if you have no issues with your booking then things are fine, but don't rely on their customer services once things go wrong.I have given them every opportunity to resolve this situation without going public, but they give me no choice.

Awful customer service.
","Over the years I haved booked loads of holidays with Expedia, but next time I will think twice. Customer service is terrible! I had booked a trip to Florida as it was our 25th anniversary and we were going to renew our wedding vows. After booking I rang Expedia to see if I could upgrade one of the rooms to accomodate an extra family member who had decided to travel with us .I was told this was no problem but there would be an additional charge, which I willingly paid.However a few months later when I went to print off our documents a week before our trip I discovered the upgrade had not been made, even though I had paid for it.When I rang customer services the Escelation team investigated and found the fault lay with Expedia's agent and I would be given a refund. I stressed I did not want a refund but the room situation sorted out as my daughter had flights booked to the US but no where to stay.Over the next week I rang several times usually to be put on hold for long periods of time at a cost of almost ?35 in phone calls. I also sent emails all to no avail.

ABSOLUTE DISGRACE TO THE TRAVEL INDUSTRY
","I Recently booked a four day break to Majorca to celebrate my wife's special birthday, with our ten year old son. Itinerary number 110680749676.The total cost as a package deal was ?1,119.66 including private transfers booked through Expedia which cost ?145.18. On arrival at Palma airport, no one was there as arranged to pick us up and take us too our hotel. We had to go to the information desk at Palma airport and seek assistance, where we were then directed to the transfer company's office, where a driver was eventually located to take us to our Hotel. Not a very impressive start to our short break.Just as we thought things could not get any worse,our return private transfer booked through Expedia did not even turn up at the hotel to collect us at the end of our holiday and take us back to the airport as booked and arranged through Expedia. We then had to get the hotel to phone a local taxi company very quickly, to get us a taxi to take us back to the airport to catch our return flight. The cost of this was seventy five euros. This was in addition to the ?145.18 i had already paid to Expedia for this service.On return I contacted Expedia, who looked into the matter and after a delayed response, stated there was a system error by the transfer company involved, which resulted in my self and my family not being collected as arranged and taken back to the airport to catch our return flight. Despite Expedia saying, they would refund us for our additional expenses incurred by myself in relation to this matter, they have not done so. Now all emails i am sending to Expedia are being ignored and not responded to.In short i would say, Expedia standards of customer service are an absolute disgrace to the travel industry. When a customer has a genuine problem, they simply refuse to resolve it, and meet there contractual obligations.I will never use this shambolic set up ever again to book a holiday.David M."

",Spent an enormous amount of money on a holiday to Thailand and paid significantly more to fly on specific dates. Expedia changed the flight times and simply told us to take more time off work.

Generally good, but beware the flight fare codes
","I have used Expedia to book flights and hotels numerous times and have not had any problems. Earlier this year we booked business class flights on Virgin Atlantic with Expedia, as while they were offering the same price as the airline directly, Expedia do not charge credit card fees. Our flights are for later this year, and a few weeks after booking we discovered we might want to change our travel plans. Yes, the ticket is non-refundable and non-changeable and I am not disputing that, but when dealing directly with Virgin we are able to make changes subject to a change fee and difference in fare - even on discounted tickets. It turns out that our tickets with Expedia are in a fare bracket the airline doesn't even sell, which means that although we are willing to pay the difference, we cannot and we are stuck with our travel dates. If this had been made clear at the point of purchase we would have elected to book direct with Virgin who would have let us pay a change fee and the difference in fare should our plans change. With this in mind, I will not book business class flights with Expedia again unless the fare offered is considerably cheaper than the airline directly.EDIT: Following correspondance with Expedia through TrustPilot, one of their advisors called to confirm that the above review is correct and not an error, as implied by the team here. On a positive note, it must be said that they called exactly when they said they would."

Closed hotel being advertised for sale

One of our team will be in touch when the investigation is complete.Thank you for taking the time and trouble to write to us. Regards,Customer Relations DepartmentExpedia.co.ukMY EMAIL SENT ON 31 MARCH 2016Dear Sir\Madam I have made the following reservation on your website: Torrent Bay by Intercorp Hotel Group, Sant Josep de sa Talaia 27 Mar 2016 ? 30 Mar 2016 | Itinerary # 111059864066Torrent Bay by Intercorp Hotel Group 27 Mar 2016 ? 30 Mar 2016 , 1 room| 3 nights COMPLETED Confirmation # EXP?632884686 When I arrived to ibiza after 8 pm I was driving around the town trying to find the hotel that I have booked. I have driven for about two hours trying to find this hotel with two very young kids.I have asked 6 different locals who can not speak English to find out where the hotel were and no one knew where this hotel were. I have also stopped a police car to tell me where this hotel was they have told me where it was and I did go  for the second time to  find the hotel as I have already looked at google maps and looked at where the hotel was situated but there was no sign of the hotel. I have driven for about another  hour trying to find the hotel but again it was not possible so I have stopped two locals and they have phoned the number that you have given on the confirmation and they were telling me office was closed and there was no one in this hotel.They have also called the police to find out whether this hotel existed and they have told me that it did exist so I have driven again to the same  location for the 3rd time. Luckily this time I have seen a very small writing on a wall with the name of the hotel I have walked around the hotel but all gates were closed but reception area was outside the gates so I tried going in but it was closed there were no lights, mattresses were all over the place and it was like a war zone and a ghost town. I have went to a nearby restaurant and lucky enough a gentleman tried calling the local hotel number again but he was advised it was closed and then he tried calling another hotel which belonged to same group of hotels and he was advised that the hotel was closed and I should make my way to the Marina Palace instead of that hotel. I was so upset,angry and tired at this point as I had two young kids my wife and myself and no one to contact. I basically had to ask police and locals for help to be able to get a resolution. I have made my way (lucky enough that I had a hire car) to the Marina Palace and when I went to the reception the lady at the reception told me that the hotel I booked was closed so my booking was transferred there instead.I have asked how come I never knew anything about it and why was I not told anything about it before I arrived? She could not answer much she just said that they did try contacting me but I have never received any emails or calls to tell me that my booking was changed to another hotel.So I have basically asked her to give me a room asap and let me go for the time being as my kids needed to eat and sleep as soon as possible and I have said I will speak to the manager in the morning. On the night I have had another terrible experience as there was a party next door and we could not sleep in the bedroom so I had to take mattresses to living room and all of us slept on the floor in the living room to be able to get some sleep. Another issue was even though it was in my booking no cot was provided to my 9 months old baby, no double bed, no kettle in the room etc?.. After having a ruined first night I have went down to speak to the manager called Stephanie she did listened to me and I have asked for a confirmation if they have tried calling me to let me know about the change of a hotel and she said her friend tried calling but they could not give me a proof. So she offered me a deluxe room and I have requested a late check out which I certainly have accepted at the time as I had no other choice. However I am really disappointed as i was only there for 3 nights anyway and I have specifically chosen Torrent bay so my kids go to the beach in a walking distance and it was being advertised as a family hotel. Otherwise I would not have chosen to stay in a hotel where there was no beach in a walking distance and it certainly was not a family hotel where I stayed the first night( B Block). Overall it was a very disappointing experience as it was our anniversary. If it was not for locals and the police I would have had to try and get another hotel and probably pay hundreds for it.More importantly my holiday was ruined all together. I am looking for a compensation to cover all my holiday costs as this is a holiday where I have wasted money and not enjoyed a minute of it as you are selling a hotel that does not exist any longer and you don?t even let anyone know about it!!!! (See the screenshot below taken today from your website)!!!!!!!!!! I have used many companies before for my holidays however never had a such a terrible experience as this.I really hope you can rectify my losses financially as you will never be able to rectify it emotionally. Looking forward to a satisfactory response as soon as possible.UPDATE************************************************************** BELOWI have been given ?50 Expedia credit for the bad customer service I have received so I can  use on any booking on their website.I have just done that and the booking cost was just under 30 pounds and I was thinking that I would be getting the ?20 to use on another booking but to my surprise even though my booking is only for ?30 you lose the whole ?50.I have sent an email to expedia about this and they have been refusing and telling me that if I was to cancel the booking I was lose the money.They did send a link with terms and conditions however it does not mention anything about using less than ?50 and losing it if the booking is below ?50.They have basically given me a ?50 goodwill and they took ?20 back for booking a hotel for less than ?50.I was given this as a goodwill for your bad service and you have basically taken it back for making a booking on your website.Have I seen this on your terms and conditions I would have just booked a more expensive hotel or indeed a better hotel to make sure I used the full ?50I think expedia never makes things that clear in their terms and conditions so they can get the goodwill back from their customers.I have had such a bad experience with expedia for my last two bookings and I will not be using or recommending them to anyone.I am hoping they can see my point by leaving this review as they dont seem to get what I am trying to explain in any other way."

Truly Useless & Untrustworthy
","It is a shame that there is no option for no star review here.  Expedia are truly useless & utterly incompetent.  They managed to foul up my holiday last year and I was given the vouchers which did not actually cover the shortfall - I gave up trying to explain this to the sub-normal cretins they employ in their call centre.  On trying to redeem one of these vouchers, they had arbitrarily imposed a few other T&Cs which are not to be found on their website.  I would cheerfully pay more so as not to deal with Expedia.  It seems that they train their call centre staff to be as obstructive & unhelpful as possible - using people who do not actually speak English is not the greatest idea.  I will never use these fools again. Itinerary: 111800349975.  Update - someone from Expedia left a message for me, but had such a strong accent that I could not fathom their number. Advice remains the same - avoid this shambolic bunch. Answer to the latest response- try leaving me a message with your number - that enables me to call you back. -----Try 1100 tomorrow or email me"

Cancelled Flight on Itinerary #111799591013
","2nd Update 31/05/16: Well, what a day! After another long conversation, and at times heated, with Rohan, once again he has been able to sort things out. It has at least helped both the airline, Aer Lingus and Expedia.co.uk to realise that there was a serious error in their systems. Many thanks again to Rohan whose job I would definitely not want!Updated 31/05/16 I have just received communication from Aer Lingus to tell me that we are still booked on the 06:10 from Denver to Chicago. Rohan, if you read this, please contact me. Despite assurances from you and Expedia.co .uk via my itinerary,mI am verry unhappy about this situation. Someone is lying, someone is trying to con me. I want answers, in writing, NOW,I booked a round trip this morning for September from Malaga, Spain to Denver, Colorado which was being advertised on the Expedia website. The journey involves three flights in both directions. The first part of the return flight from Denver to Chicago was advertised as leaving at 09:15 with connecting flights on from Chicago to Dublin and finally to Malaga. I pressed the button to purchase the flights and received a copy of the itinerary. Reading it I saw that there was no flight on the return leg from Denver to Chicago. I phoned Expedia and was told by a customer service agent that the airline had cancelled the flight. When asking why it was still being advertised the response was it takes time for things to catch up.I subsequently had several discussions and phones calls with customer service who first told me the flight had been changed to 08:20 and then to say that it was 06:10. As we have a 6 hour journey to Denver the night before, we would not have chosen a flight so early. In the end I accepted the early flight ( and to be truthful we were offered a refund) because we were losing confidence in the whole process and were just wanting to secure a flight back home! This afternoon, 9 hours after I made my booking, the 09:15 flight is still being ""sold"" on the Expedia website. This to me is just a con to draw people in and I have been very unhappy with their business practices. The customer service advisors on the phone have been pleasant and as helpful as they can be and I have no complaint with them. It is the dubious selling tactics of Expedia that anger and disappoint me.Update 28/04/16. After a long discussion with Rohan from Expedia's social media department, the original flight that I had been purchasing from Denver has been re-instated. I had pointed out to Rohan that the 09:15 flight was still available on the Aer Lingus website. He carried out an investigation and foind out that it was Aer Lingus that were at fault and not Expedia. There are a few lessons for Expedia to learn from this experience as well, such as not sending out an itinerary with a missing flight on it with no explanation to the customer but both Fazal yesterday and Rohan today have restored my faith in Expedia."

?150 add on for baggage
",I booked my package to Italy with BA (having the option to book with other airlines such as Easy Jet/Ryanair) but this actually comes with a 23kg baggage allowance. My friend and I bought saw the same flight with this 23kg baggage added to it before booking. When I called to add my frequent flyers via customer service they had told me 1 week before my flight that my 23kg pp (3 people) was not included! Customer service members only seem to be following a script ?rest assured ma?am your issue will be resolved and you will get compensated?. I have not yet had any sort of compensation and have had Expedia claiming to be handling my issue with the 'escalation team' for over a week now (handled by 3 different escalation teams by now). They have failed to get back to until 2 days later giving me the same exact excuse on more than 2 occasions. Due to the 28 day Data Protection policy they are using to say they can?t view my page when I booked to say that my 23 kg baggage was not included. Very sneaky and terrible customer service considering I have always booked several holidays with this company. I purposely paid extra to fly with BA so I can check in bags (bringing gifts) but now they are attempting to get me to pay ?150 for checked in bags for 3 people and Expedia MAY compensate that amount back!!

Poor deceitful behaviour.
","Original Rating = 1 Star ; So I booked flights yesterday, only to discover on the confirmation that one of them was wrong, so this morning to get a refund (as it is within 24 hours), but I was told you can only cancel the same day and the advertised 24 hours is if you were to book at midnight. I asked for where it said this in the terms and conditions and was sent an email consisting of a single sentence. I asked for the reasoning for this rule and was told it was due to me not being in the USA (or going there), which when I asked why it states 24 hour cancellation even to Australia, I was told it was actually due to the Airline. I then went on to ask then how come if I was to book with Qatar direct it would be okay, so I was then told by advisor; that it is actually due to what the airline enforces. As far as I am concerned these are basic excuses, which are not true (Qatar Airways denied that the rule was enforced or created by them).Update; After this, it was agreed that I would receive a ?200 hotel voucher and ?200 refund, which I feel more than makes up for the stress and mistake in flights. The social media team are great (I can't say the same about the regular phone number team)."

Expedia - not a great experience, would not recommend
","I booked flights through Expedia at the beginning of January.  The transaction would not process and after several attempts the return flight only was booked!  I eventually got through to customer services who told me I needed to contact Ryanair.  I phoned Ryanair and eventually spoke to someone who said there was nothing they could do and I was back to phoning Expedia!  I told them I wanted to cancel as the whole booking was a complete fiasco.  Was told they could not do that and I would just have to rebook the outbound flight directly through Ryanair, which I wished I had done initially.  Found out via bank that is was down to Expedia breaking down the payment into lots of smaller payments, which they then think could be fraud, however, Expedia system should be setup up to decline the whole transaction and not book half a trip - just creates lots of hassle for the customer to sort out.  What use was a return flight when I had no outbound one?!  Used a debit card to avoid charges only to discover recently that I had been charged by my bank for a Euro transaction, when I paid in GBP!  I am not a big complainer, but this prompted me to submit feedback.  I would not use Expedia again after this experience."

The agents are liars!
","I booked a (flights and Hotel)holiday at the end of January this year with expedia. When I checked the details on the airline website the name details of one of the passengers were incorrect, taken down incorrectly by the agent I spoke to on the phone. I then contacted expedia, spoke to numerous agents who then informed me that the airline ticket office was closed, I spoke to the airline office and they informed me that they were not in fact closed. I rang expedia again, I was assured that the ticket would be changed and that I would not be charged for changing the ticket as it clearly was the fault of the operator. I then reviewed my bank statement and I had indeed been charged a nominal fee for the ticket change. I spoke to expedia again and was informed by another agent that I had apparently agreed to pay the fee, which was incorrect. I was also charged for another ticket and have not been issued a refund for the incorrectly spelt ticket. I am so cross, the agents either don't understand english or they are lying. Don't book with expedia, if you do, do so at your own risk."

Terrible service
","Booked flights with Expedia and had a confirmation though, within 2 days part of the flight was cancelled but Expedia did not give us a refund.  Instead I had a very unclear voicemail that I could barely hear the company name on let alone what the issue was.  When I found their number I went through to the sale line (the menu is awful) and got through straight away, then had to wait 25 minutes to speak to someone from refunds to find out that they hadn't refunded anything and told us that 50% of the flights had been cancelled and that they could liaise with the airline to see what they could do.  They've known this for a week and didn't have any alternatives ready for us.  They should just have refunded us for the flights and have clearly told us by email and phone that the journey was cancelled, instead we've wasted a week and the flight prices have increased.This is not the first time Expedia have given terrible customer service either.  They are a really poor company for customer service go elsewhere and save yourselves the hassle."

Cashback
","I booked flights with Expedia through Topcashback. The cost was ?1600 and I should have received ?16 cashback. The claim was refused even though I have an account with Expedia and can show the booking and reference. To be fair to Topcashback they tried to claim the cashback but Expedia have turned my claim down. The amount of money is not significant but, on principle, I won't use them again.Why am I posting here? I wouldn't want anyone else to book expensive travel tickets through Expedia thinking the cashback makes them more attractive because they renege on the transaction even though you can show it took place legitimately.-------------------------------------------------You do pay cashback to Topcashback.co.uk but for some reason best known to you, it was declined in my case""As you know we have recently contested the network''s decision to decline your cashback.It is regrettable that despite our efforts the network is standing by their decision and that we cannot pursue this any further for you."""

disgusting customer service and will NEVER recommend or use ever again
",I recently booked a holiday to New York and went through the booking process only to be kicked out when payment details were being taken. I called and was advised no booking in my name. I therefore booked again. No confirmation was received. On checking my online Banking Expedia had infect taken 2 payments for 2 holidays. unfortunately I had input one digit incorrectly on the email address and following several phone calls at my expense and several emails and promises of response within 24/48 hours it actually took 5 -7 days sometimes to get back to me. I was advised no refund as the flights were non refundable even though I contacted the airline myself and was advised that the flights could be transferable Expedia refused to assist me and have refused the refund. NEVER use this Company as their customer service is atrocious and they make promised to come back and never do.

nightmare
","We booked a holiday including flights and transfers to Greece in Nov15.We thought everything was ok as it said on our paperwork we did not have to confirm anything.On the night before our holiday we decided to stay at Gatwick in a hotel as we had an early flight  and arrived about 5pm.  But within half an hour we received a e-mail from Expedia saying our accommodation had been cancelled and we needed to phone them, initially we thought it was a scam but decided to phone just to check. We were told the accommodation was shut for maintenance and we would have to go elsewhere, we were on the phone for over 45 minutes and it turned out the call was to the Philippines.  They found us alternative accommodation but not near where we wanted to go.

Incompetent and dysfunctional car rental experience.
","Itinerary # 7166317348163 Confirmation # 1031533928Farcical and incompetent. I discovered the prepaid car rental reservation was for a Europcar location that did not even exist. On double checking with Europcar they informed me the reservation did not exist. Expedia's customer support was completely ineffective. It is a disconnected Indian call centre. They even asked me for the phone number for Europcar! They were unable to access the EuRopcar reservations system. To make matters worse it was a Bank Holiday in the UK, most car rental offices in the UK were closed and those that were open were charging a premium for new rentals. After 1 hour 39 minutes on the telephone Expedia eventually agreed to refund within 2-3 days the original cost of the reservation plus the premium for a new reservation made by myself. It is now day 4 and no refund has been received. Caveat Emptor!Update : 2 more l-o-n-g calls with Customer Services, one more than 90 minutes. They asked me for another card number to make the refund to. Result: No refund 13 days after originally being promised a refund.Update : Credit now received ."

Awful post sales service
","Let me start by saying I am a long time Expedia customer and have booked lots of travel through them over the years. So I came to use them for our Florida holiday booking both a hotel stay at Universal Studios and our Universal tickets through them. Every other seller that sells universal tickets sells 14 days tickets that are valid for a year. When you book through Expedia it asks for dates, during the booking process I selected a range of dates as at the time we were unsure of our plans that many months in advance. When the voucher came it didn't have the range of dates, but just a single date. I called Expedia, only to be cut off after waiting on hold for a long time. So I took to their facebook page. I received a reply to say that my tickets could only be picked up on that one day and that my tickets were valid for only 2 days (when the website says 14 days!). After several messages and panicking on my part over a few days it was established that they are indeed 14 day tickets but that they do have to be picked up on a single day. No where pre sale does it state that the date you put in is the only day the ticket is valid for and that you will void the tickets if you don't pick them up on that day. I have had to post on facebook several times before I receive a reply, I was refused the option of speaking to a supervisor because no one was available. Expedia refuse to refund me or to change the date by 3 days. Now I am in the horrible situation where I either have to forfit ?600 or cancel other paid plans and lose money that way so we can pick up tickets. Expedia have not responded despite my complaint being escalated to the priority complaints department. I will be contacting trading standards and ATOL to see if I can get my money back that way. I will also be cancelling our ?700 hotel reservation and will not be using Expedia for future bookings unless they finally sort this out and give me my refund."

Refusing to Confirm Flights & Dodgy Website Blocking
","Expedia,The flights were booked almost a month ago and even today you are not able to provide a confirmed itinerary.  This is clearly unacceptable.  Please cancel the flights, refund the payments I have made and send a confirmation, by return, to my email address.Also, stop using Trustpilot to contact your aggrieved customers - it is clearly a ridiculous pretence - you have their personal contact details so contact them directly._______________________________After posting this review yesterday Expedia replied in their usual way - please let us know how we can contact you.  They don't provide an email address or a phone number to talk to the person dealing with the complaint.  Why don't they just use the email I have used to book the flights to contact me - seems they are only interested in appearing as though they are dealing with the issue.Almost a month has passed since booking the flight and Expedia are still blocking me from accessing their website and still cannot provide an itinerary for the flights I have booked.  I have taken screenshots this morning of both.Shockingly bad!After having booked our flights and hotel through Expedia (itinerary 7168258943911) expedia sent me a message saying that there was a problem confirming the return flights.  I called and the call handler could not confirm whether this was the case or not but seemed insistent that it was my problem and that I should contact the airline directly.  Despite the fact that I had paid expedia to do this for me.  The call handler eventually agreed to contact the airline but, several hours later, left me a message saying that she had not been able to get through to the airline.I am now unable to confirm with either expedia or the airline whether we have return flights, as the cost increases on a daily basis.  I have also noticed that expedia are blocking me from accessing their website.  They have planted cookies on my computer that allows them to redirect me to a 'website undergoing maintenance' screen when I try and access their site.  Using 'incognito' to gain access to their site does not help because my itinerary is permanently unavailable in any case.It used to be a good service, but has become extremely frustrating and somewhat dodgy as they block customers with problems they are unable to solve."

Proof: Stay away - false promises and poor after sales
","We booked a Xmas holiday to Cape Town for a family of 4 adults, flights and a 5 star expensive hotels costing us nearly ?10k all-in. On their site we had noted two promises1. That you receive a max 7% discount if you booked a hotel as well as a flight. That is exactly what we did but received no discount. When complained to customer services they said because we had not clicked on the flight email the system would not apply the discount. We further complained that their system knew we had booked fights already (all booked under same itinerary). we received another reply that they look into this and come back to us within 28 days. No reply. We complained again and again through the link on their website and each time waited 28 days and still no reply. That cost us nearly ?200. Now the second promise.2. Our booking had a price match policy that if we find same hotel room elsewhere cheaper up to 2 days before the reservation they would rebate us the difference. The reservation had free cancellation up to 48 hours in advance A month before we made our reservation we found another agent, Travel Republic was offering same room cheaper. So we filed a claim and send them PDF files of the offer as they had asked. They looked at and promised us to send us a rebate of ?177 or we could cancel reservation. We agreed to the rebate and took our holiday in Dec 2015. Now its April 2016 and 4 months on despite many emails still waiting for the promised rebate and no reply. Interestingly the price difference by the time we flew out ws some ?220 due to Rand depreciating in value but we did not bother to claim the extra ?50 thinking they pay us ?177.So, in total Expedia cost us some ?400 and ignore our claims, worse we have no one to talk to and no regulatory bodies to complain too.Never again will we trust or use Expedia for holidays!======================================================Proof:Iteniary number 110230958533Case ID S-114713576Email from Expedia to confirm they rebate us ?177 under price match was dated 28/11/2015 - now 4th April 2016 and no rebate and no reply to further emails... Come on Expedia, We can hire a solicitor and take you to court for their own admission per your email that you us under your own price match policy!UPDATE: A nice guy (name Luke) called me after this review. We went through everything and we were awarded both the price match promise and the discount for the package. Special thanks to this guy. My only remaining comment is why this took nearly 6 months from Nov 2015 to April 2016 and why one had to resort to having to leave negative reviews for them to take action. Thanks Expedia anyway. I keep my options open tho for next holiday!"

Poor service that just keeps getting worse....stay well away!!!
","UPDATE:  Was called last week.  Although they admitted that sometimes the write up is written in a way to get traction and stand out from other hotels, apparently this doesn't mean the info is misleading, even when not correct...huh?  Was then promised a call by Friday....no surprise no call received!!!Booking Reference: Expedia.co.uk booking ID (flight): 61ZIQU4IS (75), Expedia.co.uk booking ID (hotel): 623376553Arranged a holiday through Expedia to Rome.  We didn't choose the cheapest option as wanted a hotel that clearly stated that they had Spa facilities we could use.  These included baths, etc, rather than treatments which you would expect to pay more for.  This is clearly stated on their site which I sent them a copy of.Although quite simple to see they made an error, they waited the full 28 days to get back to me, only to say that I used a different email address for my complaint from the one I booked with and would have to start the process once more.  The fact that I provided my full and correct details as well as all booking reference numbers, why would you want to irritate your customer even further when you have clearly messed up their holiday?It is very clear the customer comes last.  I would have thought an early apology is basic for most companies let alone one that is dependent online and through recommendation.Its clear they don't visit and vet their hotels they advertise with.  For the small saving I will be using a more reputable company in future as you can't fix a poor holiday.Good luck!"

Worse customer service/after sales service EVER
","I have booked with Expedia a number of times and because everything has gone to plan and I have not needed to contact them again,  it has been fine.  If you gave any problems post booking,  they are completely uninterested and unhelpful.  It has made my holiday a stressful horrible experience instead of the relaxed happy one it should be. It takes forever to get through, then they put you on hold forever, then either cut you off or say you will get a call back and just dont bother.  They ignore emails as well. On top if this they are robbers. I booked a holiday over the phone abd without my permission they took ?7 extra from my bank. Its not a lot,  but its the principle.  They havnt got back to me or refunded money. I will NEVER EVER book with them again and advise anyone to stay away from Expedia at all costs.

","Very poor! It's extremely difficult to get any reply from the company if you need to change your flight, they will keep you waiting on the phone for ages. Would recommend to avoid using their services...Very upsetting and frustrating"
433,"Hi Maureen, upon investigation I can see that the hotel reservation was cancelled and refund was processed for the full amount by the Hotel on the 4th March '16.

Itinerary 7145738113655
","Chasing a refund since 4/3 Two calls to customer service, first said would call hotel, look into and ring me next day - no callCalled today, operator first tried to call the hotel to see if they had refunded and then looked again and told me it was processed 4/3 and he would send me an email with the details.  Then basically ended the call, 2 mins before the email came through saying the amount, the date and the cc details but, as I said It has not gone to the bank!So where do I go now, really don't want chat with the call centre who seem to have no idea.Expedia?Anyone out there!"

Double charge to my account itinerary : 111485155884
","I have just booked s long overdue holiday to Palmar, Mallorca. Well I have used Expedia for all my holidays and this is the last time. My first attempt to make payment didn't go through so I tried again, but then the site had a glitch and I had to do it all again. By this time the price of the holiday had gone up a few pounds. Long story short I have been charged twice!! Been on phone to customer support for a hour and hopefully I will get my refund, apparently it will take up to 72 hours so can only wait and see.I don't know how to reply so here is the itinerary number : 111485155884Hi Luke was wondering if you could check my account and see what is happening with regards to the refund?

Terrible customer service and communication
",Our flight was cancelled last minute and the airline weren't able to offer us a new flight in time. So we applied for a refund through the airline and then were told we had to contact Expedia for them to provide us with written confirmation that our bookings were never used because we never made the trip! I was assured I'd receive this in 72 hours. A week later and I am still waiting. Every time I am on the phone to them I am put on hold for between 35-57 minutes. Unacceptable.

Appalling customer service
","Just had the worst experience using Expedia. There was an issue with one of the names on the flight ticket for my holiday so I rang up and was put on hold for well over an hour and when they finally picked up the phone I was told I would be charge an extra ?142 to change 3 letters on the name. I have never experienced a customer service experience like it, the way they handled the whole situation was awful and then to be told I had a massive fee added to the already expensive holiday I payed for with them was just disgraceful. There was no apology, not even from the manager which I asked to speak with. They didn't offer or give discount, a slight fee discussion, nothing. I just got rude service and completely incompetent people. All for a mistake that I didn't even make nor was my fault. I will never use Expedia again, they couldn't even speak great English so I'm not even sure if they understood exactly what I was saying. For anyone thinking of booking with them, don't."

13 weeks and counting to get ?1000 refund for cancelled flights.
","My family and I booked a hotel and flights to Sharm in Egypt for March 2016.  In mid december, I became aware of the travel advice re Sharm being extended and the cancellation of the flights on the Thomson website.  I contacted Expedia to get a refund on 30th December.  I have now phoned over seven times and spent numerous hours on the phone most of whihc has been on hold.  I am continuously told that a) it is not their responsibility, despite the ATOL certificate making them responsible for the whole holiday b) the refund will be processed in 2 to 4 weeks c) the refund will be processed in 12 weeks.  It is now 15 weeks since the flights were cancelled - we have received the hotel refund but still await a refund of over ?1,000 for the flights.  I dread to think what they would do in a crisis. Now had a response from Expedia asking me to contact them but giving no contact details. No call back or e-mail following last exchange with the call desk despite promise to call on Monday . Please give me a way to contact you without being placed on hold again."

?1900 paid for a holiday never taken
","When booking with Expedia, don't expect them to advise you of any conditions.  We booked and paid to go on a family holiday to Dubia at a cost of ?1,902.58.  All details were given to the operatives on two separate occasions, they even booked our tickets for the plane, so there was nothing left for us to do but turn up at the airport.  Unfortunately what they hadn't told us was that UAE require a minimum of 6 months on your British passport, which we did not have, so could not fly.Expedia initially told us we could transfer to another date, but this was then changed by the supervisor. Really don't know where to go with this; this was our holiday for the year and we can't afford another. I would have thought the minimum you could expect from a travel agent is advice about entry requirements.  This has been the hardest lesson I have ever learnt and leaves me sick to my core. Don't touch Expedia with a barge pole."

Capitalising off of a terrorist attack
","I had 3 flights booked on 25th March and we were flying back on the 28thOne was cancelled (to Brussels)One was rerouted as a connecting flight to Brussels where it was flying from a different airportThe last was not affected, but we would have missed it due to the change in our second flightOn both Brussels and Croatia airlines websites it says that we would get a full refund on flights booked on these days (even nonrefundable ones), just contact your travel provider. Unfortunately for us this was Expedia. The first person I spoke to didn't understand I was trying to rebook for 10 minutes. She then took 10 minutes to transfer me. This woman told me that there are no seats available on the 25th - 28th March. We have flights booked on those days and I asked her to cancel them not book them. After a lot of back and forth about CANCEL rather than BOOK she finally told me I would get a full refund in 2-12 weeks. This whole fiasco took almost an hour which should have been 10 minutes. I am appalled about how the customer service team has handled this and I am glad we cancelled rather than re booked; I will avoid Expedia like the plague from all future bookings."

Price not as advertised- find another comany I did!
","Attempted to book a short Easter Break for myself and my daughter. Was going to book online but I was unclear how to add hold baggage to the quote, so I rang them. The lady on the phone said they would send a link when I had booked (so I would have to pay separately). I said it was easier to book online now I knew this and she told me to stay on the phone until I had booked because sometimes the link isn't sent with online booking. I carried on booking online and attempted to pay the ?665 quoted online and the website said it was unable to complete the booking. The lady said that this is because the airline prices change continuously and the actual price is ?685. No where does it say on the website that you may have to pay more than the advertised price. She tried very hard for me to complete the booking. I didn't- I booked the same holiday with another company for just over ?600 and was able to add baggage into one payment."

Worst company. DO NOT USE and avoid at all costs
","I have been dealing with problems since we booked in January which are still not resolved. First had to deal with RUDE call centre employees. Was charged Over ?900 for holiday that should have been ?400. Was told that the booking was made with Taiwan!!!?? Have spent over 5 hours on the phone cost around ?70 extra on my phone bill. No one could confirm any booking until i rang airline and hotel directly. Was passed from person to person putting me on hold for hours at a time and was told they still had no booking for me on their system! THEN booked transfers as we were unable to do this over the phone and was told everything was fine HOWEVER i thought id best be safe and email the transfers company directly when we booked last month and they said they had nothing and copied me into an email asking Expedia to include it on the next list they would send over. TODAY i have double checked with the transfer company who said  Good afternoon Dena, Here in Palma de Mallorca there are not this booking, please contact Expedia because should be some problem with you booking.Kind regards.I just cannot believe this awful service!! ?60 for transfers which have not even been confirmed with the transfer company!! I strongly advise that if you are thinking of using expedia to AVOID at all costs. They are the worst company i have ever had the displeasure of dealing with and they are greedy and money grabbing and have NO customer service team at all. i am so angry and upset with this service i dont even know what i am going to do next- we have 7 weeks before we go away and i cannot see this being sorted so we will probably have to pay another load of money when we get there for a local taxi.

Flights it would have been cheaper to go direct
","Really disappointed to find out that if I had gone directly to the airlines web site I would have got my flights cheaper. The irony was I then had to go to the airlines site to book seats and luggage. I do not see the point in using Expedia and will not use them again, Very disappointed customer.I went straight to the airlines web site after booking with you so comment re the price difference is suspect. Your ?30.00 charge also adds to the cost, I didn't find a mention of that any where prominent on your site. I think a note at the final price section should say something like ""the price you see may not be the price you pay"" apart from advising it's in UK pounds."

Cancelled trip due to poor health, customer service made promises - none kept :(
","I cancelled a trip (Itinerary no 110449463835) weeks ago due to ill health. I was informed that partial taxes and my car hire would be refunded within 5 - 7 working days. During the call to cancel I requested an email to confirm I had cancelled and what money would be refunded to me and what was non refundable so that I could claim with my travel insurance. I was told I would receive the email.On the 2nd March I emailed expedia asking where the email and where my refund was. I was assured that I would get a letter confirming my cancellation of the above itinerary within 48 - 72 hours (see email response below)On the 5th March I sent another email asking where the email was as this was now well over 72 hours - no response 6 days later (see email below).On the 11th March I tried to contact your customer service - initially I could not get through as it claimed I had no itinerary under the above number. I used a forthcoming itinerary to eventually get to speak to a customer services adviser. She told me the same, this booking did not exist - I explained it had been cancelled but that I was waiting for confirmation via email for my travel insurance - she could not help me. I asked to speak to supervisor and was told one would phone me back within 30 minutes - that was 9 days ago!On the 14th March I again used a forthcoming itinerary to get through to their customer service and asked to speak to a supervisor - I was assured that by the next day, 15th March, I would receive an email with what amount I was being refunded and confirmation that I had cancelled the trip. Now 20th March, still not heard from them.I have simply asked for an email from Expedia 1) confirming that I cancelled the booking2) how much I was being refunded (and was promised the refund weeks ago)3) how much I was not being refunded."

","Just been on Expedia to get some ideas of a holiday & picked a random hotel to get some ideas & as we were looking at various options they obviously tracked our usage & increase the price as they probably thought we would be buying that holiday. What a rip off totally disgusted with Expedia, extremely poor  customer experience, they should be ashamed, sooooo disappointed. Try going the other way & offer a better price instead of trying to rip off your customers.

Would never use again
","I have bought holidays in previous years and thought that Expedia were a reputable company, but I have tried to book a holiday and told there was an error and to try and again, so on their request I tried a few times for it to go through, without any success, only to find they have taken over 3 grand out of my bank without my knowledge and putting me overdrawn, I have tried to call customer services and have gotten nowhere. I am now unable to book my family holiday which is fast getting booked up or even buy food and I am no wiser as to when I will get my money back. After doing my research it seems like it is a common problem which has been going on for years and is totally down to an error with their systems.  I would totally avoid this company and use someone with a better customer services department, who will actually try to help you sort out any problems.  After receiving the below reply from Expedia, I had already tried to contact the support desk before writing the review, surprisingly they answer straight away when they think you are trying to book a holiday but when they put you through to dispute I was put on hold for ages and I have just tried to call again and they hung up on me.  Surely the money should be released back into my bank straight away as soon as the holiday doesn't go through, I should not have to chase to get it back, you have wiped my bank out and surely should register an error before trying to take the money for the same holiday 4 times.!!"

Should be no stars
","When things are going ok Expedia is fine but when they are not they just don't want to know.

The next day I tried again & everything was fine. I received confirmation & vouchers immediately. I did not receive any for the failed attempts so thought nothing else of it until the credit card statement arrived and we had been charged 3 times for the bus and twice for the theatre, Despite numerous e mails and a recorded delivery letter, the only correspondence I have received is an e mail saying that they have no record of my complaint - hence the 2 account reference numbers below.

Avoid booking with Expedia at all costs
","I posted this review back in March following our awful time in Rome. Initially was offered a desultory ?50 ""compensation"". I refused and wanted to escalate the matter. I emailed customer services 3 times and was always told that my complaint was being ""sent to the escalation team"".  Having heard NOTHING back at all, I now assume the ""to escalate"" in Expedia speak means ""ignore and put customer complaint in the nearest bin!"". Expedia - you have just added useless complaint handling to awful customer care. Well done!This was not straightforward case ""not being allocated the correct room type"" on arrival. We arrived at the serviced apartments  in Rome which I had chosen because of their location; close to Spanish Steps and where my niece was staying as my husband cant walk far. The  apartment had also had very good write ups on Expedia.  No one was there when we arrived  and when we tried to call the number on the Expedia website, which we had been given when we booked, we got some kind of standard response in Italian but no one answered. People in the restaurant next door listened to the message for  us and took pity and called someone for us. After 45 minutes, someone arrived and said we had no reservation, despite having fully booked and paid for this in advance via Expedia. The gentleman who arrived said we had to go with him on a bus about 2km to another apartment. On arrival this was a shabby, dirty place with no natural light or outside space and nothing like  the standard  of the one we had booked or in the part of Rome we had wanted to be. Also was above some kind of warehouse and we were woken very early by guys shifting goods into vans so very noisy. There  was a very stressful moment when we first arrived when the guy said we might have to pay again as they had not had any money from Expedia...we felt very vulnerable and were panicking about having nowhere at all to stay or having to pay a lot of money to stay elsewhere for the weekend. So far we've been offered a very insulting ?50 compensation by Expedia - about a fifth of what we paid. Crap service, crap company...AVOID at all costs...."

AVOID IF YOU VALUE YOUR TIME AND MONEY
",Nothing but poor service and aggrevation from booking with Expedia.1. Booked flights and hotel online. Error message came up but it suggested to try booking again. Booking never went through so I called and booked over the phone instead.2. Looked at my bank account following the booking. Expedia were charging me 6 times because that is how many times I had try to resubmit online. Turns out they were taking my money but not making my booking. This left me overdrawn and not being able to pay my bills until the refund came through in 5-7 working days.3. Got an email 4 days later saying my flights weren't ever booked due to an error despite receiving confirmation emails. The email advised that I had to call Expedia to resolve the issue. I then got told I had to book the flights directly with Ryan Air!4. Emailed Best Price Guarantee quote. 2 months later I still haven't had the refund.5. Emailed confirmation of direct Ryan Air booking for refund between flight prices. Got told refund would be issued. 6 weeks later and still nothing. 6. Have had to call customer service 3 times. Each time they can't find any notes of previous conversations or emails sent. Last call I was on hold for 30 mins before I got through to anyone and it took 30 mins to establish what I had originally emailed 2 months prior.7. Despite being told in a previous call I would get a refund after not receiving it and calling again to chase I've now been told that I need to send my proof in a different format!I could go on and on if I had the energy.The only positive out of this is that I have received ?50 compensation for the inconvenience but this is only from my own stubbornness and persistence.I was always a fan of Expedia and now I will never use them again.

","I paid almost double costs to get a flight home from Middle East at Christmas time.  However, I wanted to reschedule my return flight by one day. I called customer services at great cost from Saudi and agreed to pay 189 pounds to move the flight. I was told I would get an email confirmation within 24 hrs. This never arrived and I checked with the airline and the change wasn't made. I then recalled customer services, who said that the change had not been made, but the costs would only be around 30 pounds, so I agreed that.I then checked my credit card balance and noted that I had been charged two amounts for over 400 pounds. This is on top of the 40 pounds in call charges to the UK.I complained to customer services, whom asked me for the itinerary number, which I supplied. However, despite an number of follow up emails, Ive yet to receive a response, not even a confirmation that they received my itinerary number.I book a number of long haul flights per year, and a load of hotels. However, due to costs of calls to try and sort this issue out, plus the non response of the customer services team, ill take my business elsewhere and  willl contact my credit card company to discuss options for illegal charging of my card.I always liked expedia, but not any more..Itinerary No 110343995881Just had an email now sending confirmation that my flight had been changed, but I guess Expedia cannot read well, because my complaint is about all the agreed and unauthorized payments they have taken from my credit card to change the flight. I would have been cheaper to loose the flight and rebooked another return flight. I want my the cash you have stolen from me back. Just to repeat to ensure you understand me, you have stolen from me and I want my money back. It is easier for you to just give it to me as a good will payment rather than deal with me cause I will not stop till I get my stolen money back. I hope now that you understand what my problem is. Don't ask me to send confirmation of  payment cause I have emailed you copies of my credit card statement twice before.Give me my money back! Give me the costs for calls back, I am not responsible for your operator incompetence.I am not a happy customer. You are thieves."

Great service when needed to cancel
","I booked this overly priced ticket. Called to cancel they stated would only refund the taxes. I argued that on their policy it says 100% refund if cancelled within 24 hours and they voided my ticket.Great service.Saved me a lot of money, even though their tickets are quite pricey compared to other sites."

Well disappointed in this company
","We were promised 1000 nectar points from the flight. Even though we connected our nectar number during booking. The points didnt come through, so after the trip we had to call them up and ask them to give us the points, which they said they did (and promised we'd get them within 24 hours) a week has passed and still no points. In my opinion, this aspect of their offer is scammy.ItinNo 19581483474"

Terrible Customer Service Experience
","**UPDATE*** So Expedia eventually confirmed that they were liable for the cost of a package which they had said was included with our holiday and advised that we needed to pay for it upon checkin at the hotel and claim the refund back from them on our return.  Been back over 2 weeks now and sent the email as soon as we returned.  No acknowledgement of receiving or processing the refund request from Expedia.  Followed up with a telephone call and they advised they did have the email and that it can take anywhere between 2 to 12 weeks to process the refund but that someone would call be back in 24 hours to discuss.  Over a week after this, I am still awaiting the call or even and email response.  Absolutely nothing from Expedia.  Horrendous customer service from start to finish....Thank you to RR and the escalations team for the prompt resolution in this matter.  2 days since raising the issue on trustpilot it has been resolved.  It is a pity that it took a bad review to get to this stage and I would suggest that something is done at the call centre level to ensure issues can be resolved in a timely matter to reduce the number of bad reviews which are ultimately a result of their poor service.If my initial experience with customer services had been the same I received from RR, Mani, Amit and Tameem I would be giving 5 stars and a glowing review.Thanks for your assistanceRR: Itin#111056759104Having called the sales team twice prior to completing a booking online to ensure the package we wanted was included, we got confirmation from the Hotel after the payment was taken that the package was in fact not included in the price online.Almost 1 month and 10 phonecalls to Expedia.co.uk customer service to resolve and no further on.  Apparently my case has been escalated at least 3 times and I have been waiting on a manager calling me back with an update for over a week now.The customer service team have continuously provided contradicting information and it is apparent that no-one there has a clue how to resolve this.  One advisor mentioned that they contacted the hotel and the package could not be made available... however, the hotel advised me directly it can be for an extra cost (which we would expect Expedia to cover due to their previous mis-selling advise).Terrible experience and would never recommend Expedia.co.uk to anyone!"

Booked free cancellation hotel, took deposit out 2 days later!!
","Booked our hotel in Mexico 4/1 on a free cancellation contract but Expedia took one nights price out of my account 2 days later on 6/1which I wasn't aware of and can't get back.Paid agreed price on itinerary plus ?227 deposit at the hotel who just told me to contact Expedia to claim it back if only it was that simple.I seem to be talking a different language when trying to explain to the company, now having to try claim the money through my bank.Totally appalled and would never book with this company again or recommend them. Feel cheated. Itinerary 7154844636261as requested.I have decided with so many hotel booking companies not to use Expedia again, life is too short!Unlike all the others websites that offer free cancellations when you book they legally take 1 nights hotel costs out of your account within days of booking, I was not aware of this.All the sites book the same hotels and they all basically cost the same so please be aware of this before you book your hotel!"

Best Price Guarantee is a total con to trick you into booking without looking elsewhere. Agents lie to get out of it. Do not rely on it !!!
","I booked a hotel with Expedia as they always heavily advertise their best price guarantee pretty much on every single page on the site including checkout. But when I came to actually use it I found out that they will do anything to get out of it and exhaust you into giving up. It seems to be a mechanism to just lure customers into booking with them with confidence and then find out that they can't cancel the booking without incurring massive hotel charges (even though Expedia doesn't charge). I applied for the price match online as my case was pretty straightforward - and they say that their process ""really is that simple"" and ""just let us know and we'll refund the difference to you. It's that easy"" - these are direct quotes from their website. It certainly was anything but. I got a response within 24hrs that the agent could not find the price online and he was getting a figure that was not even an option on the competitors website - Lie no.1 as the price is still the same even today. I resent him the screenshots of each of the stages of booking right till checkout. 4 chasing up emails later - no reply, radio silence. Then, thinking that the agent is clearly not interested, I resubmitted the application online again, this time with another competitor (slightly more expensive) thinking to myself, surely it won't be an issue now. Wrong. Again I got a reply promptly within 24hrs but they declined as the agent said on the screenshot he could not ""see"" the room type, dates or the price or currency of the booking ie nothing important but he could see the rest of the website (fantastic lie of epic proportions) - Lie no. 2,3,4,5,6. The screenshot is very straightforward and clear, no ambiguity whatsover. I resent them again. Since then, like previously, radio silence - 3 chasing up emails later, no further replies from them. It's obvious that the agents are reading off a standard ""decline"" script (as its obvious the second agent did not even view my screenshot) hoping that people would just give up in frustration. This is wrong on so many levels I don't know where to start. I am about to take the matter up with UK Trading Standards for false advertising. The irony is that I was given an Expedia 10% off coupon by email directly from them which for some reason did not work at the time of the booking due to a glitch on their website (as I've just tried it again and it works fine now) and pretty much covers the bulk of the price match, so if I was to cancel and rebook now (I can't as there are fees) Expedia would still not really be out of pocket. The coupon expires tomorrow. To be fair I had an issue with Expedia a few years back and after raising a complaint they did sort it out very well so I thought I'd give them the benefit of doubt as things sometimes do go wrong, but here I am again, nothing seems to have changed. I fear that this going to get escalated and cause more issues esp as the hotel is on promotion (on Expedia and other sites) which expires tomorrow and then they really won't be able to verify the price match online. Shambles and very concerning that they are actively committing fraud, especially for a multibillion dollar company.Update :Hi - my itinerary number for the first booking is 111277362732. I made another booking last night which looks like it could also have the same issue but I'll confirm that later if it does. Many thanks for your help,Edit - 15/03/16 - Thank you for resolving the issue promptly and efficiently. Fantastic service. I will amend my review a bit later to reflect this. Kind Regards"

Child Air Passenger Duty Refund
","We booked our holiday for August 2016 through Expedia and we queried at the time the changes for the Child Air Passenger duty being removed from 1 March 2016 and how this will be dealt with.  We were assured that it would be refunded once we confirmed the ages of the children with Virgin Atlantic advanced passenger information.Spoke (eventually) to someone at Expedia and I have been told that the duty will be refunded once our trip is completed.  The reason for this being that we had booked as 4 adults rather than 2 Adults and 2 Children.  This is completely incorrect as our booking confirms 2 Adults and 2 Children and the ages of the children were on the Virgin Atlantic website when I logged in.  Also it was Expedia who made the booking and took all the information from us.I cannot believe this refund is so difficult and I have major doubts that this amount will be refunded at all.  Please watch out for this if you made any bookings prior to 1 March 2016.The itinerary number is Itinerary # 110592924769, thank you."

Expedia cancelled our hotel the day we arrived without telling us
","We booked a New York hotel room with Expedia, our first experience of the service.  They took payment immediately.Eight weeks later, they called to say the hotel had to cancel our room, and would we like to rebook it at the same hotel for ?3 less.  We were a bit confused, but that seemed fine.  It took 35 minutes on the phone to resolve though.On arriving at the hotel (at 2.30am our time, with two small children), the desk manager informed us that Expedia had cancelled our room that morning. She had double checked with them herself, to make sure, as it seemed a bit odd, and had it confirmed by their helpline. The hotel was 3 rooms oversold, and it was 9.30pm on a Friday night. Our hearts sunk; Expedia had not been in touch, and I had printed out the 'confirmed reservation' page that morning.  45 minutes of calls later, the desk manager managed to get us into a room, no thanks to Expedia.I immediately raised a complaint with Expedia, who ignored it for 28 days.  They then were confused about why I was complaining, as I had been given a room, hadn't I?  And it hadn't cost me any more?  So what was my problem?!  They then promised to get a senior manager to return my call within 24 hours, which did not happen.  It took contacting their social media team with the complaint to get anyone to get in touch, and then they could only offer me ?50 voucher off their services.  When I said that wasn't appropriate, they upped the offer to a ?75 voucher.I will NEVER use Expedia again.  I do not trust them with my money, peace of mind or my family's security.  And I certainly do not trust them to recognise a problem and resolve it quickly.  They are appalling.  I have been booking trips for myself, my family and large groups of holiday makers for over a decade and this is by far the worst service any travel agency has provided."

Overall happy with service and refund recevied quicker than expected
","I have used Expedia quite a few times in the past with no problems, and this is the first time something went wrong. the airline canceled one of my connecting flights and resedualed it for the following day, which I was not able to doI phoned Expedia and asked if I could cancel the resedualed flight and was told that they would contact the airline and phone me back the following day. However, after waiting three days and still not receiving a phone call I phoned again. After being put through to the correct department I was told that they had contacted the airline and told that they could not cancel one leg of a conecting flight, which I do understand, but no one phoned me back as arranged to let me know.After being told that if I was not on the flight my return flights would be canceled I was at my wits end.And then I was given the option of cancelling the whole itinery for a full refund (I had not even considered this as I thought the tickets were non-refundable)I was told it would take 2-12 weeks for the refund.I rebooked the flight straight away, excluding the canceled flight, deciding to drive the rest of the way instead.I have now received a full refund after only 10 days (minus expedias ?20 booking fee, didn't realise there was a fee of you paid by debit card)I found the staff in the call center to be extremely friendly, helpful and understanding that it is a stressful situation and everyone I spoke to spoke excellant English It is also easier to get through during the day than the evenings (I was on hold for nearly an hour one evening before giving up)So overall I received very good service and wouldn't hesitate to book with Expedia again"

Booking our holiday- not the easiest experience
","Booked a holiday to Rome for myself and my Mum with Expedia- flights and hotel. The flights are with EasyJet and it clearly said on the Expedia website if you use a debit card you will not be charged a booking fee. Well that was very misleading. Put debit card details in, the booking fee got added in anyway. My Mum phoned up to query this and although unlike others we got through to someone straight away, they could barely speak any English, couldn't understand what the issue was and offered to do a new booking for us. However it was at a higher price and they couldn't understand our names. Given the importance of getting the name exactly right we abandoned the phone call and had to stick with the online booking, booking fee included.The other issue comes with the hotel booking. Expedia has been quite vague about stating what type of room we have- saying either twin or double. It would have been much more helpful if they could have given us the option to choose, as you would if going via a hotel directly. As this is my Mum I don't wish to share a bed with her but may have to now."

Do not book through expedia.co.uk. Use ebookers. Best price guarantee is a sham. Ignore and lie to customers
","****BUYER BEWARE - DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY - LIES - SHOCKING CUSTOMER SERVICE - BEST PRICE GUARANTEE IS A SHAM *****WOULD GIVE  NO STAR RATING IF I COULDBooked a flight and hotel on 21 February 2016 through expedia.co.uk (itinerary no. 111086747777) A few hours later I found the exact same deal ?95.97 cheaper on ebookers. Noticed on Expedia that they offered a 'best price guarantee' for identical deals found within 48 hours of booking and that it was easy to get a refund. Followed the steps on their website and submitted my claim within a few hours of booking. Got an e-mail back a few hours later saying that the deal on ebookers was not identical and that they couldn't even find the hotel on ebookers. Blatant lies!! The deal was identical and the information supplied showed this. Not only that if you type the name of the hotel into the search function on ebookers it comes up straight away. I was asked to send the details again which I did. My e-mail and 3 subsequent emails were completely ignored!!!My girlfriend then put a review on this site and within a few hours I received a phone call from expedia. I was informed that they couldn't find my e-mail address (despite them having e-mailed me previously to lie to me). I was asked for my itinerary number but as I was out I did not have it to hand. I was asked to e-mail the details again to a different person which I did. I was promised that it would be resolved by Monday 7 March. I have been completely ignored since!!I have sent 12 emails to three different members of expedia, all of which have been completely ignored.I phoned expedia yesterday at my own expense and after an age of waiting got through to a member of staff. I explained the situation and was asked to hold for 2 or 3 minutes. 20 minutes later I was told that my situation had been passed to the escalation team and that I would receive a call within 24 hours. Needless to say I have been ignored once again.Their level of contempt for customers is disgusting!! They lie and ignore you. Do not use this company and do not believe the lies that they advertise. Quick enough to take money from you but then ignore you! Use ebookers instead. Extremely disappointed and will be passing on my experience to friends, family and colleagues"

Very dishonest company who refuses to honour terms and conditions
","Buyer beware! The only thing they are good at is taking money from your account. I have made sure to buy a ticked with a possibility of changing the return date, but changing the flight was impossible, purely because you can only do it on the phone and it is impossible to get through to Expedia. I suspect the numbers they give are fake and they have no real agents. I have been on the phone for over two hours more than three times listening to their jingles. No one answers the phone.  I have called the airline who were very apologetic but could not do anything about the ticket bought through Expedia. They told me that this was not the first time they heard the story. I still cannot get through to Expedia and they are not responding to my e-mails. Avoid!My itinerary number is 110800782968. In the meantime I have managed to speak with Expedia on the phone. In their assessment it was my fault. After all it is possible to connect and I should have been more patient. This is ridiculous: I have waited more than two hours on the phone! The person I spoke to has insinuated that I was making it all up - what for? why would I decide to forfeit an existing ticket and buy a new one? I really do not appreciate that. It is disrespectful to say the least and confirms all my misgivings about the company. I am beyond appalled."

Thieves who took payment twice, still no reply to emails after 4 weeks
","I was charged twice for a stay at a Spanish B&B, once when making the booking and the second time immediately when checked in (they also used a less favourable exchange rate and I paid more the second time). I had no similar bookings with Expedia so it's definitely a duplicate payment. I have used numerous email addresses for them and their online form to report this (I am unable to call as I cannot hold for a long time due to full time work and part-time studies). Each time only got an email acknowledgement and have been waiting for a month for some reply / refund.This is the second time Expedia has tried to fleece me. A few years back, I booked a holiday and opted to pay in instalments. Looks like Expedia staff and systems cannot cope with two instalments - it took me ages to actually explain to them that they were trying to overcharge me at the second instalment.You would have thought, why give them a second chance? Well, I thought that full payment transactions could be handled without error by Expedia. I was wrong.Very quick to take your money off you but unwilling to give it back. I have NEVER had any problems with other travel agencies, and I travel a lot, and they managed to get it wrong twice.I will take them to the Small Claims Court very soon and charge them for my admin time as well. This is the only thing that works with thieves like that.Will also complain with Trading Standards.To the Expedia rep who will be responding to this: No, you are not sorry. You don't give a s***."

Disgraceful, incompetent, insulting and rude...If I could rate lower I would.
","I will never book with Expedia again.Basically I was booked flights and hotel through Expedia on the 4th March, I received my itinerary and it stated that everything was confirmed (hotel and flights with Thomas cook). The holiday wasn't until June.I then tried on the 6&7th March to check my flights and pick my airline seats, baggage etc through the thomas cook website. However my reference could not be found.I then spoke with a customer service rep at at Thomas cook, they told me that the flights had been booked and then cancelled by expedia on the 4th march. Yet my expedia itinerary said everything including flights was confirmed and I didn't have to do anything. (It was only out of my paranoia that I checked with Thomas cook so early on).I was given a reference number by Thomas cook and told that I could give this reference number to expeida to sort the issue and re book flights. Thomas cook were adamant that they had not cancelled the flight but expedia had.(It should be noted that I never received any sort of confirmation of the flights being booked by the airline, although on expedia website it states that I would receive an email once the flights were confirmed). I tried on numerous occasions to get through to expedia customer service and was on hold for well over 1hr30mins in total.Finally getting through to customer services, I was told that all was booked and I didnt need to worry, I also received an email from expedia re-confirming this. Despite me telling them that Thomas Cook had told me that the flights had been cancelled by expedia themselves.It should be noted that every customer rep from expedia I spoke with was very difficult to understand and spoke very broken English. Despite me explaining to two customer service reps and two managers at expedia what Thomas Cook had told me they were still stating that the flights were booked. I even told them that I have only had half the money taken out of my account for the hotel by expedia but nothing from the airlines which indicates that the flight have been cancelled for some unknown reason.Despite this I spoke to a rude and obnoxious expedia manager who insisted that they could not resolve this issue the same day. (all they had to do was speak with thomas cook to confirm whether the flights had been cancelled or not). Instead I was kept on hold for 1hour while a customer rep tried to find my booking detail on the thomas cook website using expedia booking ID and the reference number I had tried to use on numerous occasions...adamant that the flights were not cancelled.After debating my case and being put on hold for the whole evening I spoke with another team supervisor who all of a sudden stated that the flights had been cancelled, however he could not confirm how he new this and could not tell me why three other colleagues were adamant the flights were still booked.The manager shouted at me down the phone because I expected that they resolve the issue the same day. (All they had to do was call Thomas cook). I was then told that they could only rebook the flights if I gave them ny card details again and then they would refund me if I was eventually charged twice for the airline flights.(Even though on my expedia Itinerary it was still documented that everything was already booked)I was absolutely disgusted by the appalling service I was lied to and shouted at by customer service supervisors, I was sent emails after my first conversation that stated that the issue was resolved when it clearly wasn't as the flights were still not booked. I was spoken to in a derogatory manner simply because the customer service staff were completely incompetent and couldn't do a sensible thing as to resolve the problem and actually call Thomas cook with the reference number I had been provided with.Instead their solution was to speak to me in a disgraceful tone and suggest that I pay for flights again at my own risk of being charged twice (Because according to all but the last member of expedia staff I spoke to stated that my flights were booked).I was not prepared to give my car details again and asked for a refund which they were reluctant to provide. I am currently waiting on the refund, I was offered no resolution or compensation for the stress and hassle this has caused me. Instead I was spoken to in an aggressive and condescending manner by both managerial staff and customer service reps.If you book through expedia...be prepared to be let down, shouted at and totally ignored, what a totally unprofessional and abysmal service.Itinerary #111217686745 still waiting on a refund which I was told can take up to 5 working days, I'm not getting my hopes up.---------------------------------------------------------------To Expedia RepNow I have provided the  Itinerary #111217686745  can you assure me that my refund will be paid back into my account within the 4-5 working days, which was stated to me on the 09/03/15."

I am happy to discuss over email however , my address should be with my booking or the email that I used to originally send me complaintsOk thanks I appreciate your help. Do you have any contact info for this department ?  Just I have sent be email 3 times to the address on your website and had no response .Hello again, I am sorry but I still have heard nothing and it's starting to get ridiculous . How many messages do I have to send for someone to actually reply? You say my complaint has been forwarded to the correct department but why did it take me having to write a bad review to get a response ? When is someone actually going to reply ?"

Totally misleading advert on Expedia
","We saw a reasonable stay advertised at Africa Safari Camp, Salous, Tanzania on Expedia. Place looks great - really glad we contacted the Camp direct before booking. In the itinerary it clearly states 'free airport shuttle.' Now, as you land at Dar Es Salaam airport you would expect that the shuttle would pick you up from Dar Es Salaam airport? No, the Camp advised in their correspondence that the 'free shuttle' is from Salous airport - not Dar Es Salaam where you would be landing if you purchased this product from Expedia. I made 2 phone calls to Expedia to double check that the shuttle was free and at what time would the shuttle be at Dar Es Salaam - the advisors did not know, and at no point did they clarify that no shuttle is available from Dar Es Salaam. I've double checked all information, and no doubt the phone calls made on 07/03/2016 will be recorded. Think this is grossly misleading and I will be reporting this to an external body for investigation. Expected more from Expedia - the old adage seems true - If it looks to good to be true then it probably is! Glad we checked and didn't end up waiting at Dar Es Salaam airport for a shuttle that does not pick up from there!!**No Itinerary number as I did not book the product**EXPEDIA - I am sure you will find this product on searching your own website from 24th April - 1st May 2016. Certainly, our local Trading Standards Officer (emailed 10/03/2016) is interested in investigating this further, pending your response to me. Thanks."

The worst service I have ever experienced
",REQ: S-119269536I displayed opinion regarding this case on the 9th of March. The case was not resolved until now. I did not get a refund for cancelled flights. They stopped replying on e-mails. I called them S-119408482. They only cheat customers. It takes long time.If you want to save money and time do not book with Expedia. I probably lost 169 pounds with them and I will never get it back. They are cheaters.

WARNING!! DONT BOOK WITH EXPEDIA.co.uk
","Over the telephone i paid Expedia.co.uk over ?3000 for my wife and myself to go to St Vincent ( itn 110078216771 ) which should be this Thursday but had to cancel 3 weeks ago due to a close family illness. I telephoned Expedia firstly to see if we would be refunded any of our money and he explained we would only get back the tax element of the flight and all the hotel costs which both came to over ?1800 by which we agreed to cancel.I have received the tax element (?228) but nothing of the other ?1600 plus.I have spent hours on the phone chasing this and seems to be all over the world but now Expedia are saying I booked with Travelocity USA!!! who they advised me to call in America but they say the booking is not with them. I am now at my wits end as Expedia.co.uk cant seem to help me and look like they have done a runner with my money. I have received I email which they say will take 28 days to sort but that time has now elapsed and still nothing. All the calls, and for hours on end, I have made be it America or UK end up in India and with mostly the rudest and most unhelpful people I have ever encountered. if I don't get a satisfactory result from Expedia I will not let go and will take to the media ( TV and newspapers ) for the British people to know what they would be dealing with."

Exploiting People's Misfortune
","Having booked a holiday to Las Vegas last February (2015) with Expedia for October (2015). Unfortunately I suffered a heart attack a few weeks later and was hoping by the time October came that I would be well enough to go on this holiday. As it got closer I realised I would not be well enough to go. I rang Expedia to try to put the holiday back until I was well enough to travel. Over a dozen calls later and having been promised a customer service manager would ring me back on seven occasions and not once did I receive a call from any manager. I finally after a lot of stress and hassle got Expedia to agree to put the holiday back till April 2016. For this to happen we had to pay ?200 and the holiday was over ?500 cheaper in April but we had to agree to paying the extra or lose the holiday completely. After all the stress and hassle I ended up being rushed to hospital by ambulance with a suspected 2nd heart attack. Nine hours of tests and investigations later and luckily for me it wasn't a heart attack but the Doctor's reckoned the severe chest pains and trauma was brought on by stress. Since then I have been struggling to get my health back to a manageable condition. We are now only a few weeks from traveling on the rescheduled dates but I am still not fit enough to travel on a long haul holiday. We are going back through all the hassle again with Expedia, I was on the phone last night for over an hour to be told we would have to pay between ?450 to ?650 extra to move this holiday back until October 2016. If you booked the same holiday now it would cost ?2047 it will have cost us neatly ?3400 for the same thing. I understand that it's not Expedia's fault we haven't been able to take this holiday but they have really taken advantage of my misfortune. Well and truly.Hi S, as requested here are the Itinerary numbers. This was the original booking Itinerary number 18050848453 and this is the current Itinerary number 19875220528. Many Thanks. DaveHi ^S sorry i missed your call, i have tried to call back on the same number but cannot get through. I am available now or later this evening or call me tomorrow. Many Thanks. DaveHi ^S, nearly 5 days since since I updated and asked you to call me again and still no reply. I shouldn't be surprised as Expedia always say they will get back to you and never do. Some things never change.Hi ^S, i spent nearly an hour over two phone calls to Expedia to try to get through to your department. The first call i asked the customer service department to put me through to your department and i was connected to hotel reservations. I asked to be put through to your department again and was informed they could not transfer the call to your department but gave me another number to call. The second call went back to customer service again and i ask to be put through again. They said they would put me through, twenty minutes later on hold someone picked up the phone and then put me back on the customer service queue line. Expedia wonder why the reviews are so poor. You can contact me any morning on my landline number before 1pm.UPDATEI originally did this review on 08/03/2016 and I am updating this now 26/03/16 with no reply from Expedia, Due to my ill health we will not be able to go to Las Vegas on 03/04/2016. I will now have to cancel this holiday due to the fact that i cannot afford to pay the extra money on top of what i have already payed Expedia. They haven't got the decency to respond, listen or deal with you as a person. They take your money and if anything should go wrong Tuff. That is the response you get from them. I can't afford to lose thousands of pounds on a once in a life time holiday but that is exactly what is now going to happen. Please never book with Expedia, you'll regret the day for the rest of your life."

Charged Over ?2000 for ?500 Trip
",I would recommend never using Expedia. Due to a 'glitch' in their booking system I have been charged numerous/duplicate times resulting in an overpayment in excess of ?2000 on a ?500 booking.The accountability and ownership for refunding my money is non-existent with the onus on me as the customer to resolve the issue.On being alerted by my bank to the duplicate payments I contacted Expedia who offered a refund and compensation within 72 hours. This has not happened and due to high value of overcharge would recommend that anyone thinking of using this company should book elsewhere. It's just too much of a risk to use Expedia (just goggle to find out how many others have had the same issue as me) when there are so many other safer and honest alternatives.My itinerary number is 111196131357 if Expedia is reading this and want to take ownership of the problem.------------In response to Expedia reply. Thank you for response. It's too vague. Where is my money being held please (which company) and when will it be released. Bear in mind this is over ?2000 of my money.

Expedia - Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire! The company without accountabiliy
","I left my other review at the trust piloit about buying the flight to Japan and Expedia took the cost of the flight ?1500 twice. Expedia came back and offered ?100 vouchers or ?50 cash. They also wrote to me and offered to pay all the overdraft charge. I went back and said no, considering I had to suffer from the account overdawn for more than one week (not 72 hours as they promised) and had to find other means of funding to feed my family during that time, I would only accept ?100 voucher if this can be offset against the purchase already made and I also requested 1000 Nector points. They never came back. They take over ?1500 and think ?100 voucher or ?50 cash is good enough! If you don't play their game, they will ignore you! What a horrible company. Mr Barry Diller, Shame on you. Your company bears no accountability. ?1500 may not be much to you, but it is for a hard working family. Here is our correspndence with Expedia: -------------------------------------------------------------------------------4th March 2016Dear Marie,We apologise to hear about the problems you have encountered while booking on Expedia.

That is within 3 days.Expedia could take the money in one day and I am sure your company canauthorise the same day payment.The voucher of ?100 or the cash of ?50 is an insult to the injury. That isonly 3-6% of the money you have stolen from me.Your company stole this money as I did not authorise the payment.Meanwhile, I and my son cannot buy any essentials, such as foodor bus fair to go to the school.I have written to you separately. The only resolution I accept is that youreturn the money before 17:30 on 4th March 2016. Otherwise, I willproceed with the court procedure and report your company to the police fortheft.Yours Sincerely,Marie---------------------------------------------------------------------------7th March 2016 Dear SabiIn order to resolve this quickly, please confirm the following.I am willing to accept the ?100 Voucher if and only if this can be set offagainst the cost of the trip which I have booked 2 and 3 March 2016 and credit me with the extra 1000 Necter points.

Still waiting on a response
","An on going battle since 21st February and getting worse. Promised from 4 different members of staff that complaint would be resolved as it has now been 'escalated'. Now taking complaint further and will be expecting a full refund and compensation for this beyond poor and stressful customer service. Expedia are not only falsely advertising their best price guarantee policy, but promising customers that their complaint will be resolved. This is beyond acceptable and we have all of the evidence to prove it, which will provide an excellent case for the complaints authority. I advise anyone to not book through this site and advise friends, family and colleagues the same."

I would not use Expedia again - they  mis-sold me a product and failed to address my complaint properly
","I rang Expedia's call centre and purchased a return ticket from UK to New Zealand.  During the conversation I made it clear that I needed flexibility concerning the return date as it was likely to change.  I was told by the adviser that if I changed the return date I would have to pay an extra ?200.  On that basis I purchased the ticket.I did need to change the return date and contacted Expedia.  I was very surprised to be told that the additional cost would be ?700 - ?200 fee for changing the date (to which I had agreed when I purchased the product) plus an additional ?500 fare charges.  I asked to cancel the ticket but was then informed that the ticket was non refundable.  I was therefore left with no alternative but to pay the full ?700 to ensure the flight home on the date required.I think any objective listener to my original call would conclude that I had purchased a flexible ticket and that I had no reason to believe that I would be required to pay anything in addition to the fees to which I had agreed.  Additionally, I was not informed that the ticket was not refundable if I chose to cancel  it.  I believe this constitutes the mis-selling of this product.  Had I known about the non refundable nature of the ticket and the likely hood of an additional ?700 if I did need to change the date, I would not have purchased this product.  I  expect a customer purchasing such a product to have been given proper information upon which to make a decision whether or not the product was appropriate to their needs and acceptable value for money. Expedia failed in that duty to me.I complained to this effect and was told that the ?Escalation team? would consider my complaint and respond within 72 hours.  I eventually did get a reply a week later.  I was told that I was not mis-sold the product and the extra ?500 would not be refunded to me.This is not acceptable.  I therefore wrote to Expedia on the 23rd January 2016 demanding that they reconsidered their position.  They promised to reply within 28 days.  They still have not replied despite a reminder from me nearly a week ago.Any organisation I have worked for would take a complaint of mis-selling very seriously and ensure prompt investigation and responses to the customer concerned.  It seems Expedia don't care.The intinary number is:110405918660It is now the 13th March and I've still had no reply to my written complaint or a response to this post. Its now 21 March and they have not even acknolwdeged my reminders to respond to my outstanding complaint - I've down graded my rating to one as they are clearly ""blanking me"".  Unbelievable way to treat a customer.  I've now requested a copy of the recording (under the provsions of the Data Protection Act) when I made my purchase.  Lets see if they reply to that."

","Twice now I have gone through the process of trying to book a family holiday on the Expedia website to find as I press the 'BOOK NOW' button, the price for the holiday has all of a sudden increased by ?400-?1,000. Having given it an hour, I went back and done the exact same holiday and still they lie about the price, until the point of pressing the 'BOOK NOW' button....and HEY PRESTO! the price has gone up again. This is obviously a new SCAM they are employing to take advantage of the weary parent who has spent the last 4 hours trying to find a perfect family holiday, to be desperate enough to take the more expensive amount, through sheer exhaustion.........WRONG, WRONG, WRONG.

DONT BOOK - ITS NOT THE LOWEST PRICE, AND MORE HASSTLE
","I booked for the lowest price for flights... which it was but then to add additional bags you CANT! (some carriers) So you cant pre order your baggage for a discount, nor any other facilities on-board a flight ie special diets etc.  This means you CANT CHECK IN ONLINE only at a desk. And have to put up with what your given and get no discount on bags/food etc. Therefore costing more than with the carrier direct!

4 months for Price Match refund
","If you want a travel company with good customer service, do NOT use expedia.co.uk.After finding the exact same holiday cheaper elsewhere, they ""promise"" to price match and refund you the difference. I enquired, with proof, and the same day got a response that they will push through a refund and that it will take 5-7 days. This was 4 months ago now, and every 3 weeks or so, I email asking why I have not received the refund. They have had numerous different responses, ranging from ""due to technical issues it shows pending on our system"" to ""we have processed the refund XXX GBP which will be credited within 5 to 7 days to the same card that you used to book with us"". Apparently, it has been processed 6 times now... lies, obviously.I can safely say that I will never use them again.EDIT: Hi Expedia, please chase up for me and restore some dignity to the company, thank you. Case ID : [REQ:M-12695014] for itinerary # 19974055090EDIT #2: Thank you for dealing with the refund quickly after I posted this review, and for the goodwill gesture. I suspect that if I didn't make this review, my matter would still be unresolved as it went in circles for 4 months and to be honest, it was a very simple solution.

Misselling Mayhem
","I telephoned expedia on 15/2/16, after the website had failed to process my booking payment. I was quoted a price 23% higher than advertised online; the member of staff said that he could see the lower price advertised online, but said he was only able to process it at the higher price. He checked the details were like for like and told me that I would get the lower price by purchasing at the higher price from him and using the price guarantee process to reclaim the difference. I was very wary about this, but he checked the bookings were like for like and assured me that it did qualify under the 'best price guarantee' and that the money would be in my account within 7-10 days; he also confirmed that our conversation was being recorded. After much persuasion I did as I was instructed, but then within a couple of hours received an email to say that I was not entitled to the price advertised. I have sent 3 emails in reply over the past week, outlining how expedia had already checked all of the details and confirmed that it did apply. Nobody has responded to my emails. I would like to know - are you honouring your promise, or are you refunding my money in full? Expedia continue to advertise this hotel at the lower price that I was originally trying to purchase it at. Unbelievable!In reply to your response, my itinerary number is 111017994054"

Trying to change flight with Expedia and British Airways because of Zika virus
",I'm giving Mani 5 stars for his help in changing a flight booking with BA due to Zika virus. The whole early process with Expedia has been very long winded and extremely frustrating. 3 weeks later and despite many phone calls I was no closer to changing the flight. However once I spoke with Mani from the Social Media team things started to progress and he managed to change our flight destination (Despite British Airways being extremely difficult). So Mani gets 5 stars.Expedia get 3 starsAnd British airways get 0.

Mixed Reviews - Itinerary 18910771514
","I have been happily using Expedia for a number of years. I really want to be fair as I usually recommend them (I recommend my sister on her last holiday with a great deal on Expedia), however in this occasion, they have made a simple transaction long and painful. I had to cancel a trip (family bereavement), and after much negotiation, Expedia promised for a refund. I have had an email confirmation that the refund will take 2-12 weeks. Its now been 10 weeks!! Is Expedia really going to drag this for as long as possible? I really hope not as I would still want to use them, but I guess we will have to wait and see.Dear Sir/Madame,Thank you for your reply. Please see below my Itinerary number: 18910771514I have originally put this in the main title.Regards"

Still Not Received My Money Back!!!!!!
","The website was not working when I was trying to book flights therefore I decided to phone up and book. All was going well until I received my confirmation email, then 5 minutes later I received another one with a different booking number. I instantly phoned back to inform them of this, the woman ensured me that the second one had been cancelled and I would not get charged double. A couple of days later I check my bank statement to see that ?418 had come out of my account TWICE. Ive phoned several times and keep getting told then same thing that It will be refunded to me within 5-7 days on a priority basis. Now 1 month on since I booked the flights, I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED MY MONEY. So disappointed, would not recommend to anyone!!!!"

Transfers not honoured
","Will never book with Expedia again and would strongly recommend avoiding this dodgy company that clearly doesn't care about its customers. Booked a 5 night stay in Vienna with flights and accommodation. Got through to payment confirmation page and told that payment hadn't gone through and to try again. Clicked confirm 3 times before thinking to look at my bank account and sure enough, ?1850 frozen from my account pending transaction. I wish I'd seen the reviews on this site before booking because it seems to have happened to a lot of people. Rung customer services and after 45mins on hold, was told they were having problems with their systems (apparently it was happening to 1 in 3 customers - direct quote from the adviser). If you are taking that kind of money incorrectly from 1 in 3 of your customers, you are not a business, you are a bunch of criminals. I was then told the reason the payment didn't go through was that the price had gone up slightly in the time I was booking. I was pushed to pay a 4th time to secure the exact holiday I had booked, including hotel, flights and return train from the airport, and that the ?1850 would be back into my account in 3 days. I was reluctant but booked because I didn't want to lose the trip.The money was returned and we received the confirmation of the booking later which was fine. However we were told specifically that the train return would be sent closer to the time. 4 days to the holiday and no email about train transfers so I've just rung customer services (again another 30mins on hold) to speak to a lady who repeatedly called Jacom despite having my name Jacob on the screen in front of her. She tells me as the transfers arent on the itinerary, we don't have it booked. As if to highlight her lack of understanding of English, I hung up in a completely frustrated state and she rung me back saying ""I'm sorry the line disconnected"" (""I know, I disconnected it"").I would love to hear from someone competent in Expedia to explain to me why I:A) had ?1850 frozen from my account for a transaction I didn't makeB) was told to re-purchase the holiday for a slight increase in price and not told that the package now didn't include a return train ticketC) have just had to experience some of the most incompetent customer service I have ever seenHoping the holiday does go well when it comes but quite worried as I've no chance of receiving any form of customer service if it is required.."

No refund after calling 4 times and waiting for 1 month
","I booked a hotel for 2 nights which cost just over ?50 pound however the payment was apparently declined on the website so we had to pay over the phone. I later found out that they took the payment 3 times due to an error with their website, I had to wait on hold and speak to manager for them to apparently request a refund. I was informed this would be in my account after 5 days. After 1 week of not having the money refunded I called again and had to wait 30 minutes to speak to a manager about the situation, the phone call was then cut off by Expedia. I called a 3rd time to be told the money would be refunded and they wasn't sure what happened. A week after being promised the money would be refunded, I have not heard anything regarding the refund and am calling for a 4th time."

NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER USE EXPEDIA!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","As the title says NEVER use expedia for a car rental!!! Me & my wife booked our 10 year anniversary to Dominican Republic (punta cana) on the 26th Jan for 1 week. We wanted a nice car (we are both petrol heads) and even a rental car means a lot to me. I choose expedia as they had the best rate and i SPECIFICALLY booked a ""FULL SIZE SUV"" ""7 Seat"" Now for many people who do not know about cars that means the largest 4x4 available so it would either be a Ford Explorer, Chevrolet Tahoe or Kia Sorento this is a FULL size suv. So i turn up to Thrifty in the airport and they went on their computer and said we dont have any full size SUV, we have a Kia Picanto (mini / compact class) OR a ""COMPACT"" SUV (Hyundai Tucson) 5 seater. Now i paid $379....IF i booked a Kia Picanto it would cost me about $160 OR if i booked a Hyundai Tucson compact suv it would be $279.Thrifty said to me they DO NOT have to honor any bookings from Expedia and the guy refused to let me speak to his manager!!!! He just said you can take the car we have available and i said what about a refund and he refused that to, he said it would be $379 and you can choose which car you want the Picanto or the Tucson!!!!I wasted 2 1/2 hours at the airport on our anniversary arguing and sweating in the 25C heat complaining to Thrifty!! I then had to go to Avis next door and rent from them last minute what they call a ""FULL SIZE SUV"" A 2015 Ford Explorer 7 Seat model for $682 almost DOUBLE for what i booked with Expedia!!!!!!Calling Expedia is a joke, they DO NOT care, After calling 3 managers and keeping me waiting for over 1 1/2 hour each time they just hang up, sent several e-mails to tier 2 customer service showing the receipt of the Avis charges and NO REPLY!!!One e-mail said:  ""Dear Expedia Customer,Thank you for contacting us about your feedback on your car rental with Thrifty.We apologize for the inconvenience this may cause you. Every customer experience is important to us.We have checked our records using the itinerary number that you provided to us it show that the car rental that you booked is ""Fullsize SUV"". In cases like this, please call us for further assistance""And that is it NO more e-mails from them!!!

More expensive than high street travel agents
","Expedia give headline prices for combined flight & hotel holidays which are misleading as it's never the final price, needless to say that the final price is always more expensive than what's advertised. The final price has a ""you are saving"" line with an amount, but how is this worked out? As far as I can tell it's a random number since once you select direct flights only prices shoot up making it more far expensive than a high street travel agents, so I don't see any savings anywhere."

NEVER AGAIN
","On Feb 7th I attempted to book flights and accommodation to Santorini for my family of 5. During the payment process, the screen told me that they were unable to complete the transaction and for me to wait a moment and try again... which I did... several times. So, I gave up. My wife searched for reviews about Expedia and saw horror stories about other people having similar problems and decided to check my credit card balance. There were 2 pending transactions each of ?4395 for Expedia. My credit card provider explained they couldn't do anything about them as I have to wait for the payment to be claimed by Expedia or for the authorisation to ""time out"" which can take up to 10 days. In the meantime, my ""available to spend"" limit is reduced by ?8790 which means I am currently unable to use the card to book with a different company. I spoke to an Expedia agent who said he would arrange for Expedia to contact my card provider and tell them to cancel both transactions and that my available to spend balance would be back to normal within 24-48hrs.Did I believe him.......? NoIs my balance now correct......? No (it's now Feb 15th)Will I use Expedia again.....? No, of course not."

Ignored: Shambles in their records and lacking in communications!
","I cancelled my ""Return-Part"" of the airticket, which I bought via Experdia.co.uk, for Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City back to Hong Kong in this late January 2016 due to personal reasons. That was just more than 2 weeks ago. Expedia,co.uk acted quickly on the same day to deduct their ?31 Adm Free from my account but, to their excus that there was a ""glitch"" in their system, completely messed up my Credit-Card's Number to some body else without awaring. Despite talking to 3 Advisors in 3 different occasons and provided my scanned Statement proving my ""correct"" Credit-Card"" number and the amounts, I still have no updates as for when I would receive my rest of the ""Refund"". In fact I feel like it has only been me chasing them for any updates (I just did my chasing today). Then I was told by another CS Advisor today that I would waite for further 2 to 12 weeks from the Airline concerned (Vietnam Airline) to refund my money! What a JOKE!!!!!!To me it was failure in keeping the ""CORRECT RECORDS"" for the customers and also failure in timely updating them as well. I would reconsider whether I should use Expedia.co.uk again in any future purchasing!P.S: My Itinerary No. is: 110185536426 as requested (14-02-2016)P.S: 19-02-2016 updatesSORRY! My wife did use her ""Additional"" Credit Card, ending with ""4**8"" of which I am NOT aware of, to purchase this particular air-ticket! It was only a few minutes ago today that she showed me her ""4**8"" credit card. So it is all settle now and there is no faults on Expedia in terms of mixed account information!

Over charged online by 4k and no apology
","Sent this email to them below and still havent got a apology basically i was overcharged by 4k due to a bug on their site.Having spoken to your telephone team I feel I am left with no alternative but to lodge a formal complaint on the poor service that I have received using Expedia.Having used your services to book a holiday that should have cost 1k I now find myself in debt to the tune of 5k as your site claimed the card had not processed the payment when it actually did.i then contacted you and was told a fax would be sent to my bank and the issue would be resolved,I would also receive a confirmation email.none of this happened and I am still in debt for 4K to my bank who as you might guess are delighted.I have now contacted your services again only to be told that the person I had spoken to previously (Magaraj) who I spent 17 mins on the phone too never sent the fax and couldn't have as he did not not ask for my bank details.However the new guy I spoke to (Sulamon) tells me that even if they don't get the fax details the money might be released back into my account tomorrow which is nice considering he didn't have to do anything.I am also chatting to my bank about this but I think the level of service and support after you ultimately cost me to go 4K into debt with my bank is appalling and if I do not get any satisfaction I will ensure to escalate this to the highest level and will inform social media as I work in this industryI expect a prompt resolution to this problem and I want a formal apology and some form of recompense.In addition I'd like to know how you intend to fix this issue so others don't end up in the same position.RegardsTrevor"

This is in the US and we had to ring a UK Expedia number and attempt to resolve - at extortionate cost. The wait time was incredible and the agent (Ajay) was unable to help.

mis-sold flight ticket

Terrible company
",They've taken my money with no proof is reservation after telling me to use a different card.I am now ?250 down and without a holiday.When I rang up the customer service was shocking and they were pretending they could hear me due to a 'poor line'I would have happily re booked with them until they did this.

BEWARE OF HOLDING CHARGES!!
","HORRIBLE! DO NOT USE!! I wish I had read these reviews before using them!I recently booked a flight from Expedia at ?1591. All went smoothly and I check my bank account to see that they have deducted the correct amount. A few days later, when trying to pay for my bills and rent I had noticed that all my money from my account was gone. I call up my bank to find out that Expedia had taken another ?1640 from my account -I don't even know how they got that amount. I call Expedia up and they tell me that they ""do not take payments from customers"" and that China Eastern (the airline that I will be flying with) is responsible for this. So I call up China Eastern and they tell me that if the booking was made via Expedia then they can only take the money from Expedia and not from the customer (which makes sense). So I call up Expedia again and this time they tell me that they have only taken money for plane tickets and nothing else. Obviously according to my bank account, this was a lie. So I pressed them further on this and they finally came out with it, they explained that the second amount for ?1640 was taken for ""holding""  and that it would be refunded within 7-10 working days. ARE THEY JOKING WITH ME?? AS IF THE FIRST PAYMENT WASN'T EXPENSIVE ENOUGH THAT THEY HAD TO TAKE ANOTHER (AND BIGGER) PAYMENT FROM ME FOR HOLDING! Avoid them at all cost unless you have an extremely large amount of money in your account and you like being lied to!"

Expedia Itinerary Number 110792294537
","Absolutely disgusting service. We booked last over the phone with an adviser who has somehow booked us through the Taiwan website and our booking reference has gotten completely lost in the system, The itinerary number relates to someone elses booking and my email address and phone number are not even bringing up any results!! Yet I have called Ryan air and they have the booking in our name. We have been charged TWICE but ryan air have confirmed we have not double booked meaning Expedia are holding over ?400 of our money in their account for no reason! I have been kept on hold for over 2 hours and have spoken to about 20 different people about 3 of which have actually tried to help me. Everyone else has been completeley and utterley disgraceful. They would put me on hold in the middle of a sentence and say they were not authorised for this request! I am now ?800 down with nothing to show for it!! I will be going to Trading standards if this does not get sorted out ASAP with full refundHi,thanks for your reply but the whole point is that my itinerary number is not valid!!! This is the problem i have a confirmation email to my email address that was provdied that includes this itinerary number. It was establsihed however that this number relates not to my booking but someone elses in Taiwan!!!! I have emailed so many times and when i was on the phone last night this seemes impossible to resolve as my email apparantley has no booking. But like i said the ?800 has been taken from the bank account and Ryan air have confirmed the flight. please get a UK manager to call me ASAPI have just checked with my bank and 5 transactions have been made 1 for ryan air and 4 for travel reservations!!! 3 the same and 1 different CALL NOW"

CHARGED WITHOUT A BOOKING! COMPLETE FRAUDSTERS!!
","This is seriously a joke of a company! Tried to book a simple trip to Italy, on the checkout page when I clicked submit, I kept getting a message saying the trip had changed in price, this message alternated from ?727 to ?734 continually. Very frustrating, continued to keep trying no luck, then received a message there was a problem with my card and to try another card. Did that still no luck. Both cards work fine with no issues. So called their customer services centre who advised there may be an error with the system so after trying to place a new booking through their indian call centre he said it looks as though there is no availability at the hotel! Then yes, there is there is a problem with your card! In the mean time my colleague who was witnessing the joke of a phone call managed to book with Last minute.com and checkout ?11 cheaper than Expedia!! I told the Expedia agent not to worry and put the phone down. Received no confirmed booking, no email correspondence and nothing further from Expedia. Then today from my bank they have taken 4 X ?600!!! Absolutely furious!! How can they charge a random amount to my card 4x for no reason. Call bank who told me to go back to them. Called them again an India call centre 45 mins on the phone and they are beyond useless. Won't waste my time and just issue a chargeback against the transactions. So to sum it up fraud all the way through the booking process with Expedia!!WHAT A LOAD OF RUBBISH RESPONSE EXPEDIA!! Finally spoke to a manager who assured me that he would send a email instructing the bank to reverse the funds and find out what they would do in compensation considering they have cost me over ?45 in bank charges!! RECEIVED NO EMAIL, NO PHONE CALL AND NO COMMUNICATION WHATSOEVER! Spoken to bank who unsurprisingly have not received any communications from them. And apparently this is down to an error with Expedia's system - just an outright lie!!"

DO NOT EVER BOOK WITH THIS COMPANY!
","I URGE ANYONE NOT TO BOOK WITH THIS COMPANYAfter seeing they had a marginally cheaper package deal my partner decided to book through expedia. The payment didn't go through and was prompted to try again which we did. This was done several times and when we phoned expedia direct they told us to wait a while and try again. This was done and then also a different card used. Still no booking. When looking at her bank account all payments had been taken out, over ?5,000. I was on hold in total trying to sort this out for over 2.5 hours, of which expedia never admitted fault. They said they had experienced several complaints on this issue which begs me to ask the question why tell us to keep trying if they knew more money was going to be taken out, or maybe this was a ploy to take money from all these people and hold onto it to gain the interest. We were then told after 72 hours the money would be back in the account. This has also not happened. I'm sure an apologetic reply will be sent regarding this post to see like they are doing something, but don't be fooled. They are just a penny pinching company who don't care about the consumer. I beg all of you find another company, pay the little extra which will be represented I'm sure in the fantastic service they give you compared to this atrocity of a company!!"

Changing booking
","Having booked flights from Turin to Belfast, via Gatwick with Expedia, I got an email several weeks later to tell me that I had been changed flights and now have to wait for almost 7 hours in Gatwick airport. My total trip time has now increased from 4.5 hrs to 11 hrs plus. I had booked the flights because they worked well for me, there were several other options available which were much better than the flights I've now been forced to take. When I go on Sky Scanner my original flights are still available, at a much higher price. So basically I've been moved flight and highly inconvenienced to allow for a larger fare for Aer Lingus, whilst Expedia sit back and allow this to happen.

Non-existent customer service. Avoid at all costs & spend your hard earned money elsewhere.
","I booked a hotel with Expedia for a forthcoming US 3 week trip my family are taking this April. Payment was taken immediately but the amount debited from my credit card was over ?100 more than the total price stated on the invoice. ?100 more!!!! It was lucky I had available funds or I could have been left with all kinds of extra charges by my bank for going over my credit limit. Corresponded with Expedia twice - once by telephone, once by email - and received a general response both times that it was the hotel who had taken the extra money as additional fees for exceeding the maximum number of adults in the room.  Expedia my contract is with YOU not the hotel. Your supplier has taken an unauthorised amount from my account, which contravenes with the Consumer Rights Act 2015. I haven't received an invoice/receipt breaking down the amount taken from my account. All I want to do is cancel my reservation with immediate effect!! I am still awaiting a reply from 2 emails of complaint sent on 13/01/16 and 19/01/16 (even though I have received a read receipt that both emails have been delivered and read). Absolutely terrible customer service. Will not be using Expedia to book any further hotels for my US trip and will avoid at all costs in future. Much prefer to use one of their competitors and have peace of mind that if something goes wrong I will receive the kind of customer service I have come to expect from the leading internet travel sites (Itinerary #7153724240181 Case ID : [REQ:S-116403371])"

Back to their usual ways.   Customer service? Abysmal
","Well,  ok lets at least give some initial and temporary credit to Expedia.  Following my review below I received on the Monday a file showing the transaction history and they made the necessary corrections to my account.As for the significantly overdue refund- well not quite as quick but they managed to complete it within a further 3 days.So onto their next obligation to complete their price match guarantee On January 26th I received an email from Expedia pledging the refund would be complete within 7 days.  Well low and behold did they complete this pledge?  Actually why I am even bothering writing that question.So I emailed back with a polite reminder on February 8th .  Have I received a reply , let alone the refund?  Again why I am bothering asking this.To whoever might be reading this from Expedia:Why do you let this behaviour continue?Why do you bother having a complaints department when their approach is to ignore customers and if they are forced to communicate they merely dish out lies?Are you intending taking any disciplinary action against those involved?Expedia ? I`ve run out of words to describe their level of serviceRef :  REQ:M-12531906------------------------------------------------My issues started with Expedia last October when trying to get them to honour their price match guarantee.  After several communications and severely delayed responses from Expedia however they eventually provided the necessary refunds.I then checked my nectar account to see how many points had been awarded from Expedia over the last 2 years.  This figure should have been substantial given that I have spent approximately ?10,000 with Expedia over the last 15 months. On checking my account , it was apparent however, that the points total was nowhere near what it should be.  I sent another email to expedia asking them to correct this.  Of course (and as I was now getting used to) this initial request was ignored.   I sent another request ? obviously ignored.  I then decided to email their ?complaints? dept highlighting their lack of responsiveness and appalling level of communication, whilst again asking them to correct my nectar account.  The automated reply said I would receive a reply within 28 days.  Well, true to form, Expedia again ignored this.  I sent another email (long after 28 days) to their complaints address and this time received a bland reply claiming everything on my account was up to date and points could take up to 30 days to appear.  This was clearly a load of poppycock.  The account was far from up to date.  In addition when they had bothered to add the points from previous trips I`d taken with them in most cases it was nearer 90 days before the points were added. It was obvious they had made no attempt to look at my case and couldn`t give a hoot about treating their customers with any respect or deal with customer requests/concerns.  I then decided to call Nectar to see if they could help but they confirmed the problems lie with Expedia ? which they do ? and I would have to deal with them.  Nectar , to their credit, gave me a number to call expedia on.  So I decided to call and explained the issues to a ?customer services? person.  To be fair at the time, he came across as genuinely willing to help.  One of the problems I have is to try and reconcile my nectar account is not knowing the transaction date ie the day I paid Expedia for all of my previous trips.  Although my expedia account shows a history of my bookings (only for the last 12 months though!) and the amount of points that should have been credited ) its impossible to know how many have not been credited as my nectar account only shows the dates when points were actually credited.  This means I need to know the transaction dates with Expedia so I can calculate what the shortfall is (well its obvious Expedia weren?t going to do this as they can?t even be bothered replying to emails!).  The ?customer service? person I spoke to understood this and promised me he would go through my bookings back to 2013 and then email me the transaction dates.  This was about a month ago and do you think he kept to his word and sent me  the promised email?  Well of course he didn`t and it?s just another example of the lies and apathy expedia dish out to their customers.It is worth noting that other partner companies with nectar have no problem in honouring their obligations to their customers in awarding points and in many cases the points are credited immediately.Going back to the email received from their ?customer complaints? dept. I emailed back pointing out their erroneous claims.  Do you think I got a response to this?  Don`t make me laugh!And so to another ongoing issue.  Expedia are still to refund as per their best price guarantee on one of my recent bookings.  On January 4th they emailed me saying the refund would be completed within 7-10 days.  As usual another expedia lie.  I emailed them back on January 18th asking why they haven`t done this yet.  It?s probably not too hard to guess the answer if you wonder whether they replied or not?!As a regular traveller dealing with expedia is certainly the worst experience I have ever had.  It actually amazes me a company so entrenched in lies, with such an appalling level  of communication and who treat their customers with such contempt and lack of respect is still in business.For what its worth the complaint reference is :  REQ:E-12232005 and their latest refusal  to fulfil a promised price guarantee is REQ:M-12335941"

to Expedia or NOT to Expedia? 150% NOT!
","Wanted to book an Orlando holiday for a family of 4 in 2016, flying from London. Did all the checks, put the package of flight+hotel+car together, came at a great price, ?3552. I saved this itinerary and looked at other options and saved those itineraries, then in the end came back and chose the original ?3552 and wanted to book it. So went through the process of paying, all nice and good, only at the end tells the ""Room is not longer available"". Checked separately the room at same hotel, same period, same people and of course its available. Tried several times and failed to book every time so I called the Customer Service. and now the fun begins...the guy put together same itinerary and suddenly it was over ?5000 !!! really impossible within a space of few days. he told me first that room not available - I told him it is not true because I can book it. Then he said the flights went up - possible, but in fact again not true as I checked that separately true. in the end he admits that the Discount I was getting on my itinerary, of over ?1500, suddenly it is NOT available when I want to book. Hence the price I am getting now is over ?5000 compared to my ?3552 in my itinerary.How is this possible? It looks to be a big con to attract people with false quotes and then hope convince them to book the expensive one. It is FALSE advertisement and there is a law against this. Someone should just nail this guys.NEVER again Expedia! After using them for years and years and booked with them so many times and ignored the few glitches, now thats it!"

Would highly recommend NOT EVER booking with Expedia
","When I attempted to make the booking online, I was informed that my payment had not been processed, and to ""please try again"", which I did. On receiving the same message the second time, I tried a third, at which point I decided to check my bank account. Having noticed pending transactions, I then called my bank only to find out that Expedia have attempted to take 3 transactions of ?171 out of my account. This amount does not even make sense, as was not the price of the booking (which was ?300) . When I called to request the transactions be cancelled, I was informed that the only way to have the transactions cancelled and the funds returned to my account was by providing my card details AGAIN over the phone, to pay for the package in full. I did go back and forth arguing this, as I was hesitant to provide my card details when Expedia have already taken ?513 out of my account, however after being assured by the consultant and the supervisor that money would be refunded within 72 hours, with a good chance of this happening immediately, I decided to take the chance, and pay Expedia a further ?300. 5 days later and there is no sign of the ?513 being returned to my account. The staff have been extremely unhelpful, and I've not even had so much as an apology. I will NEVER book with Expedia again, and would definitely advise against it (unless of course you have a spare ?500 you don't mind them taking!)"

Will never (try to) use again
","Absolutely awful!Tried to book a holiday for myself and my husband, to get to the confirmation screen and then be told that ""there was a problem with confirming your payment, please try again""; I tried several times and kept getting this message, even when I tried a different payment card. When I eventually called Expedia, they told me they could not take the payment, that they could do it on the phone but the price had gone up significantly (well, obviously, I mean, I'd been away from my computer for 20 seconds so someone must have snapped up the exact deal I was looking at in the meantime!... oh no wait, when I ran it through the website again it was the same price, and then I tried several times over the next 24 hours and it had increased by a maximum of ?2... not the ?50 I was quoted on the phone - obvious bait and switch). I then happened to check my bank account and, what do you know, they had managed to put a hold on BOTH accounts I had tried for the cost of the booking, so I had no money left in either of my accounts. I am not sure how they managed to secure this money if they were ""unable to verify my payment"", but when I called them they told me that I would not be able to have the money back for 3-5 working days.So here I am, with no money available to book a holiday because Expedia put a hold on my accounts and are ""unable"" to give it back any sooner; now the hotel I wanted to book has sold out while I have been waiting for my refund so I can no longer book the holiday even if I did have a complete lapse of common sense and decided to book with this appalling company. How this is a good business model I will never understand! But in any case, I will never use this company again.I don't still have the unconfirmed itinerary number; regardless, Expedia did not attempt to help me at any point during my multiple phone conversations with them and my email correspondence. They would not even give me the correct address to send a formal complaint but instead instructed me (once again) to waste even more of my time on the phone to them. The only way to get them to listen is to post a negative review such as this, so I cannot in good conscience advise anyone to ever deal with this company if they can help it."

","I asked for five identical flights with two bank cards.The Expedia operater booked the first two flights correctly but he tried to take the payments on the second card three times causing the bank fraud team to text me asking me to contact them immediately which I did while The sales operator waited.The fraud team took me through all the security and the told me my bank would have been debited three times for the same amount.I asked the sales operator how many times had tried the payment he said ""only once"".The bank security told me that was not true.I asked them to release the money once and thanked them.Aviral then repeated the correct itinerary and then took the payment.When I received the email with the flight details,the return details on the last three flights were wrong.Trying to sort out a problem with their non existent customer service is impossible,so much time and money waiting on hold with their obvious intent that you will eventually give up.After waiting on hold for an absolute age I was told on my next contact with Expedia that the case would be put under investigation and they would contact me as soon as ""the team"" had listened to the recording of the call.I stated that the flight details were stated at the start of the call and five flights to be booked with two separate cards.If the first two flights were correct and the second booking was wrong then obviously the mistake was with Expedia.After no contact for two days I reluctantly went through the expensive and time consuming effort to contact Expedia again ......if you call to book a flight your call is answered in seconds,trying to get an answer when you have to try to sort out what seems to be a simple Expedia mistake is impossible.Finally got through to customer service and explained everything and that three people's flights were booked for 7am instead of 7pm to Manilla and that they could not get from Boracay for a 5am check in.The operator said she would speak to her supervisor and change the flights.On hold again for another 10 minutes.The supervisor says "" you can pay ?405 .....?135 to change each flight "" or wait another 48 hours for the investigation team to contact you.Why is it ?405 for simple admin when 10 minutes before it shouldn't be a problem to change.I wish I read the reviews before I booked,I have never ever read so many bad reviews about one company.""how are the still trading?""Surprise Surprise still no call back ?2600 for five flights,everyone else going to my wedding is booking with other people....Great business model Expedia? I am posting my complaint on my Facebook page encouraging people no to use Expedia Expedia please do not answer this review with a pathetic attempt to make people believe your looking into the problem and that you actually care.Do not insult me and everyone else unless you can prove you can actually sort out a valid complaint.Sent from my iPad"

Terrible experience,i am at my wits end.!
","Had to cancel a trip to Luxor due to serious illness of one of the party.Phoned and eventually spoke to someone,after hanging on the phone for more than an hour.8 January 16.Flights were cancelled with a ?100 per person cancellation charge against what I've already paid,which still meant I am due a considerable  refund  ,was then told they couldn't check hotel until the next day ,and I was promised an immediate email confirmation of all details,which I've never had.I have now phoned and emailed dozens of times,and never ,ever,do they get back to me,and I need all details to present to my insurance company.What with coping with my partner who is a very sick man,i am now continually struggling with this terrible company,and get nowhere.! To be honest,all this is making me extremely unwell,and do Expedia care,not a chance.!

",You have made my friend ill with her resent booking with you.. It apparently didn't go through and then the ref number from the bank 'did not exist' She proceeded to cancel her card but to no avail as the money still went through. Long story short you actually spelt her name incorrectly!! She has booked another holiday with someone else thinking you had not booked a holiday for her.. Question!!?? Are you going to give her a full refund?? Me thinks you should!! Answers please and thanks..

awful service
",Exactly the same experience as others on here. Tried booking online and kept being told that booking wouldn't go through but then discover 3 seperate amounts of ?340 taken from my account but still no holiday booked. Apparently I will get the money refunded in 3 days time but its the weekend so maybe longer and then can call back to rebook. This leaves me with no money as I'm over my overdraft limit and therefore will get bank charges and run risk of losing good deal on holiday and flights being booked up. V.difficult to find an email address to complain too and call centre were very unhelpful.Update-I don't have an unconfirmed itinerary number. After 3 attempts at booking the holiday I came out of the website b

They don't have a clue what they're doing!!!
",Was paying for a hotel and flight online when it crashed and said there was an error with my payment and to try again. So I tried again - same problem. In the meantime I get an email from easyjet confirming my flight!!! So I called Expedia who advised only the flight had gone through not the hotel! How this happens I don't know!!! After 2 painful hours on the phone I have had to pay an admin fee to cancel the flight as adding the hotel on separately was significantly more expensive than the price I had been quoted online. I now have to wait for the money to be put back into my account and will be booking somewhere else. They were not even able to match the original price quoted like any decent customer orientated company would!!! They will not even refund the admin fee even though their error. Am waiting for a manager to call back. Awful company. Staff do not have a clue.

Expedia have stolen ?6400 off me and are willing to let it happen to you.
","I chose my holiday with Expedia entered all the passenger information, and reached the checkout screen which is a feat in itself. I used my debit card to pay because I don't like paying credit card fees. I clicked the 'submit' button, waited, and an error message came up on the screen saying my booking wasn't successful, please try again. So I did. Same message.I tried another card and I got the same message.  I thought I might swallow the credit card fees and try my credit card. Same thing. I was more than irked by now so I waited in a phone queue to speak to one of the operatives - based in Arizona, by the looks of my phone bill.The operative, offered to take all the holiday details again and it took ages because his English wasn't great.  All the dates, flight times and passenger information was entered again and we proceeded to the checkout. I offered my original debit card details. Waited. The operative said the card was declined. This had never happened before. The operative helpfully suggested I phoned my bank because it was likely that a block had been put on my account with the holiday booking being deemed as 'unusual activity'On the phone to the bank. Waited 50 minutes to speak to someone (all this time the Expedia operative was on my other phone waiting to proceed with my booking) After 50 minutes of waiting the bank said no. No block. Lovely. A long wait to hear what I already knew.But the wait on the end of a call centre queue wasn't the most exciting bit. Oh no.Whilst waiting, I logged on to online banking to find out that I had paid for the blasted holiday THREE TIMES! and ONCE on my poor partners' credit card. Yes, that's right, Expedia had FOUR lots of ?1600 of my money and I had no holiday. No wonder my card had been declined. I had no money left to pay for my holiday.Bearing in mind the Expedia operative was on the other end of my phone, waiting patiently to see whether he could blame my bank for his company's incompetence, I was able to let rip. And I did. I had been on the phone and computer for a combined total of 3 hours. I had no money and no holiday and yet, AND YET he refused to accept responsibility. He just assured me that ?6400 would be returned to me in 72 hours. Very very useful as I can't book anything, or pay for anything until my bank is back in the black. I'm ok but think how awful it would be if I needed food or petrol or if my direct debits all bounced back unpaid. Expedia phoned to say they would tell my bank to give me back my money and that would take 3 days. They do not accept the blame, they say it is a problem with the bank. So there you go, they are going to let it carry on with every other poor person who has the misfortune to book with these fraudsters. But that's ok because by holding thousands and thousands of customers' pounds, they are getting very rich, so they've no need to accept responsibility. Steer clear of this company. Book with someone else."

Prepayment awareness
",Please be aware that when booking a break on the website and you get an error message advising the break cannot be booked do not try again! On this first attempt despite not being able to book your break they will reserve money on your account and it takes 72 hours to return the money to you at least. If you try again this reserved money will just carry on adding to the reserved funds meaning you will eventually have no funds left and be unable to pay other bills. They will cancel the payments but it takes days and during this time you will not have access to your own money. The banks cannot cancel this until they have a fax from the company saying that you do not owe them money. This is not highlighted on the site. Expedia blame this on the bank but I have authorisation codes for all their attempts so this is untrue. There are many other people going through this too. Please be careful if you do choose to still use the site.

Expedia have stolen over ?600 from me!

It get's worse
","As per my previous post on here I tried to book a return flight from LGW to Salzburg ( Feb 13, returning Feb 20th)I have only received confirmation from Monach airlines for the flight there but have had nothing about the flight back with Air Berlin?? This is absolutely useless to me  - I need a flight back as well and need to know why I don't have the confirmation for it?After contacting customer services I got a reply from them referring to itinerary number 110437396971 - this is a completely different trip later in the year from London to Paris. Entirely unrelated, which I have no issues with. ABSOLUTELY USELESS. Still weeks after booking I don't know if I have a return flight back or not and what I'd need to do to next.  Expedia - can you please contact me ASAP to resolve. At this stage you will be leaving me stranded in Austria with no return ticket.Please don't ask me for my itinerary number to resolve this as I don't have one (because you haven't sent me it) - you can search me using my email of rhian.cowburn1Rhian Cowburn"

Poor experience and shocking customer service
","Never again will we book with Expedia or the other companies part of it due to the poor experience we have recently had with them. Cutting a long story short, payment was taken 3 times, despite being reassured by customer service that no money would be taken until the booking had taken place. The worst part is that after being promised the money would be returned within 48 hours on two occasions within the last 9 days, the ?500+ has still not returned. The call centre staff could not give a hoot that in 5 days we will be going on our trip and I may have no spending money. Expedia will be taken to small claims court if this is not resolved immediately.I feel begrudged for giving them 1 star in this review, but rest assured this is the lowest TrustPilot accept.Moral of the story?

Poor, poor service
","Booked (tried) a two week holiday to Gran Canaria on Expedia on Monday night and kept getting the message the transaction had failed and try again. After 5 or 6 times I gave up and tried the following morning. Tuesday morning I didn't have a booking and had been debited twice from my account for above holiday that hadn't been booked. I ran out of money on my account or I assume the money would have been debited 5 or 6 times! Tuesday was spent speaking to Expedia and Nat West numerous times to try to resolve this, Nat West were very good, Expedia an embarrassment. Cut a long story short, Expedia had to send the approval back (ie the money) to Nat West to put the money back in my account, they said they had faxed it twice but couldn't give me a fax number and Nat West don't even use faxes! So were now on Wednesday and I still don't have a holiday or the two debits (totalling thousands and thousands of pounds) back in my account. Contacted expedia on Twitter - nothing back. mailed them - nothing back!"

Expedia Customers Beware! Expedia Knowingly Advertises Falsely to Con you into paying more!
","Expedia offers very insignificant ?100 compensation since writing this post and is refusing to respond to any communication since, or even read/respond to past communication. Read the below report and tell me if you feel this is a fair settlement especially given we made a cancellation request before departure that was ignored. We were made to go & even sit apart on an 11.5 hour flight due to poor booking procedures! DON'T USE EXPEDIA! THEY HAVE VERY POOR REVIEWS ALL OVER THE INTERNET! Photos of 5* Royal Tulip - Rio include: peeling paintwork, rotting doors, dirty peeling carpets, broken & peeling baths enamel, Mouldy bathrooms, dirty breakfast room...Expedia will lie in their holiday descriptions to con you into paying more. EG 5* hotel and 5* priced hotel actually not even hostel, or 1 star standard! Bedbugs, peeling enamel, dirty rooms, peeling paintwork, rotting bathroom doors, lifting dirty carpets and a ?3,500 price tag for a week. All Expedia advertised services unavailable including tv & restaurants! Very poor Expedia and as you well know you should have all your licences removed!Also, we booked as a couple and Expedia didn't even book our flight seats together! We complained about all of the below including false advertising and even tried to cancel during the allowed period and it is all a lie as expedia will not get back to you in time befre your holiday to sort it out. Also they don't really price match and this is a lie too! Watchdog you must take this company on to name and shame them. ATOL and all governing bodies their licence should be removed as all codes of conduct breached. Expedia as you have failed to address any of our complaints and ignored all communication we will recover our money through the small claims court and this will cost you more in legal costs now. Prospective Expedia customers read the below for a general idea of what you will get if you use Expedia. There are plenty of other online companies to use and our advice is why bother with Expedia and be conned when you have so many better choices. Still no reply from Expedia even to this email below!Dear Expedia Directors Official Complaint including BedbugsWe are disgusted that Expedia did not get back to us before our flights and especially whilst we were in the cancellation period. After seeing poor reviews we wanted to cancel.Expedia ignored our requests making us wait lengthy call hold times whilst they looked into things running up hours on our call time. When the representatives spent 4 hours checking only basic information, they said they and their managers had no authority to assist with any complaint, or reimbursement, or cancellation. We were made to wait for the escalations team to call us back  and not surprisingly a call back was never received. We made this escalation after seeing the poor reviews online and additionally felt the situation with our booking was not correct after seeing a better room at a cheaper price than what we paid with Expedia on expedia's very own website. We were told by the agent that the deal he sold us was the best value for money and there was not a more cost effective way of booking this hotel and we should trust him. Clearly this was again incorrect information and our holiday was not sold correctly to us and was misleading.  We have photographic and voice evidence to support every single claim made below and every single call. Expedia can't hide from the truth.  We spend many stressful hours and only hours before our flight, given our last minute booking, to rectify this and change our holiday, but despite the clearly labelled allowed cancellation period expedia seemingly deliberately refused to have anyone available to speak to about the situation and insisted that we had to wait for an escalations team to call us back -who never in fact called. We also requested a manager in the interim who also did not call.We even emailed one of our queries and again no reply in time before the holiday. It is all just unacceptable. We were mis-sold our holiday by expedia in telling us it was the best deal they had when in fact this was untrue. Regardless of whether it was purchased as a package is not an excuse for expedia as the holiday was mis-sold here too and even into letting me believe it was 5 star accommodation, when in fact as my photographic evidence suggests this is clearly not the case. Again this is misleading information.Also the pictures on your website of this holiday are  misleading.  This hotel has been in crisis financially and this is reflected throughout the hotel in terms of service levels, food and visual quality.  We have therefore grossly over paid for this holiday as the standard was below 3 star which the hotel admits.  They are going through a refurbishment phase further to a finacial crisis the hotel had where they shut down the restaurants and let over 50 staff go.Now money is picking up for them again but they are not a 5 star standard as yet and as mentioned they admit that. We spent days running to hospitals and pharmacies for medication to ease the bed bug bites we experienced from this filthy and old hotel. This was all wasted time and also contributed to making the holiday difficult to enjoy.I am, therefore, furious that expedia mislead me and mis-sold the holiday to me in addition to not providing me even one expedia representative to speak to who had the authority to sort this out, which I suspect was a deliberate attempt to prevent me from cancelling during that period as well as the 6 hour+ total call waiting times I experienced from trying to get though to someone. This is not what I wanted to experience before my holiday and expedia ruined my holiday making the pre travel and travel itself very stressful causing lots of inconvenience. It is quite certain that expedia has failed on a number of levels breaching a considerable number of regulatory codes of conduct. In addition it is disappointing given myself and my partner have been good customers of expedia in the past.Please also note it is cheaper on expedia's own website and it is cheaper at the hotel yet expedia has even refused to price match the hotel.The pictures of the hotel that expedia provides are also incorrect. This includes the room standard and the ammenities avalable. For example, there are no restaurants available only a brekfast room and a hotel bar with room service can be ordered to. The false advertising is also a breach of uk regulatory law and is unacceptable. The room we were given on arrival would not even meet a 1 star standard as our pictures demonstrate. Again we have evidence of everything.  Expedia should take note and feel embaressed for an attempt to rob us of money given the mark up you undoubtedly tried to make. There are not all these restaurants avaliable at the hotel any more as due to their economic crisis at this hotel they have all been closed for a while yet expedia are still advertising this as part of their hotel! This is very bad and again misleading!The hotel was also so dirty that we got bitten badly by bedbugs, which again our pictures evidence. They had to remove our entire bed and bring us another which was another day gone from  from our holiday including the room change making it 2 and 4 days gone with the food poisoning. We have spent days running to pharmacies to ease our symptoms and again loss of enjoyment.Additionally our flights were not even uploaded by expedia onto the British Airways system and we had to spend hours sorting out expedia's trip which left me with no time to shop for our holiday or pack.  This is additionally unacceptable. Why should we have to run around before our last minute holiday to put expedia's mistakes right. We booked to destress not to relax and treat ourselves to a 5 star luxury holiday which was in fact immensely sub standard. When we finally arrived at the airport expedia had not booked our seats in a way in which allowed dusty to sit together which was also very stressful and our special meal request had not been made.If you would like to retain our custom and avoid bad media coverage on the lead up to our holiday and the actual experience of the miss-selling to consumer acts as well as trading standards, watch dog, office of fair trading, finacial conduct authority, ATOL, IATA then please consider this an offical notice and complaint.Understandably, we are seeking considerable compensation in resolution. If we can't resolve matters then not only will we seek compensation for the things we experienced at this bad hotel and expedia itself such as very upsetting bed bug bites (again we have evidence of this including photographic evidence) food poisoning, poor accommodation, mis advertising, misselling act, not allowing us to cancel within the advertised allowed cancellation period and loss of holiday enjoyment, we will also seek to secure compensation for all items and complaints listed and not listed here.For example we will also seek further compensation for the cost of the time taken for work wasted on this terrible holiday experience.  This court action perhaps in several submissions via the small claims court (to lower our own costs) will undoubtedly cost expedia more than 8 times the cost of our holiday with your defence. It is therefore in expedia?s best interests to settle this matter now with a very speedy resolution. Furthermore, if you should still be unwilling then we will as mentioned will not hesitate to inform the above organisations and take further action against expedia to remove the licences and shut down the website along with extremely heavy media coverage across all media and social media channels.I trust you will want to provide an extremely speedy resolution to avoid executive level embarrassment of this appalling situation.Yours sincerely"

Very Disappointed.
","I put my faith in Expedia and I feel like a fool now .Last time they rectified their mistake so I thought they were ok to use .I am 60 in March and I booked flights for 6 of my family to go to Las Vegas for 4 nights .The flights and hotel were perfect .Then we got a schedule change - they called me and I accepted the flight even though they weren't as good as the original times .Then last week I got an e mail from the airline themselves  saying they had a major change of schedule .We now wouldn't get into Vegas till 9.40 at night - the meal out for my birthday would have to go.There were 2 long stopovers now- one of 4 and a half hours, the other 5 hours .Previously they were much shorter  .    One of us in my party is autistic and the idea of having to  occupy him for 2 long stopovers fills me with dread .Also we now have to leave Vegas at 7.10 in the morning , so we'll need to be at the airport for 5 .Previously our plane left at 11.05 a/m.I called the airlines and they said we could ask for different flights as it was their fault , but we'd need to go through Expedia .So I spent an hour last night fruitlessly requesting better flights  to no avail .They said it was against their policy despite what the airlines said .So now we have rubbish flight times, the extra leg room and upgraded comfort seats are in a mess because obviously they don't match the flights we had booked .What a shambles .I am so disappointed the holiday doesn't seem as good anymore .Thank you for your fast response !!

Very bad shuttle bus experience that should not be recommended
","Where do I start!... 23/12/15 I made a booking for a shuttle bus from the airport (faro, Portugal) to the hotel. Seeing that the reviews were bad and that they was not replying back to changes that needed to be made, I asked for a refund. Take note that my holiday was from 27/12/25 - 31/12/15. I have been phoning Expedia every day until the day I depart for my holiday only to be told that they need a confirmation email from them. It is now 04/01/16 and I'm still waiting for them to inform me. That's just the first part.....Here is the icening on the cake. The day before me and my husband had to return back to England, he wanted to book the shuttle bus from the hotel to the airport as he believed it was a misunderstanding and that the service could be good. If only he knew he was so wrong!  But he booked it anyway. My husband SPECIFICALLY emailed them to pick us up at 9am as our flight was at 12:05pm. Not once... But TWICE telling them to come at 9am. What did they do?.... They come at 6am... Why? Me and my husband was still sleeping. The receptionist had to tell them to come back at the appointed time. They agreed to come back. Its now 9am... No shuttle bus... A WHOLE HOUR WENT BY AND STILL NO SHUTTLE BUS! We decided to call the company.... Words cannot explain or discribe how disgusted we were with the reply and the service they gave us. They said they WILL NOT give us another shuttle bus and they WILL NOT return to pick us up even though we SPECIFICALLY not ONCE but TWICE stating to pick us up at 9am the day before as our flight is again at 12:05pm.  So instead they said ""oh well your going to have get a taxi"".... Note that we already paid and we have no money left.

Expedia
","BEWARE of Expedia.NEVER use them if you think they are a travel agent, they are not.PLEASE read their terms and conditions, if you read them carefully you would never use them! In my opinion they Mislead people.When you sign their terms and conditions, you are the agent, they are the technology company enabling you book flights, holidays etc.This way they are not subject to any consumer laws because they do not buy anything for you, you buy stuff yourself, so you are responsible. This is not made very clear and I would certainly challenge them in court if needed. It is almost impossible to get a human on the phone, so very difficult to get any answers to anything.Their technology is flawed and can often lead to multiple bookings, incomplete booking etc. If this happens you will be carrying the cost not them! BEWARE.DO NOT USE THEM AT ANY COST. THEY ARE NOT A TRAVEL AGENT!!!! THEY ARE A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY."

Bad customer service and misleading policies
","Booked a package holiday to Prague. Hotel etc were great, Expedia were not. I would not use them again, Indian customer service team which I have no problem with if they can empathise with your position, they just talk like robots and have scripted answers to questions, not good at all. Best price guarantee is a sham, they ignored me after I sent all relevant information, I eventually rang up and was told I was ineligible because the quote I sent them did not state that the room came with free wifi (standard at this hotel) an absolute joke, should be reported as false advertising.

Change of flight time...no confirmation...and then cancellation of flight the day after we were due to fly!
","Do not book with Expedia if you can help it! I booked a Bangkok Airways flight from Bangkok to Koh Samui on Thursday 17th December around 4pm to fly on Sunday 20th December leaving Bangkok at 2100 (Flight number: PG 187Y).I received no confirmation of this booking despite their website outlining that I would receive confirmation within 24 hours. On the evening of the 18th December at 23:17, I received an email from Expedia stating that the flight time had changed to leave Bangkok at 1930. In the email it states that I had been charged for the itinerary yet which suggested that the flight had not yet been confirmed. I also have the Expedia app on my phone, in which all the flight details were present in my account, leading to confusion whether the flight was confirmed or not.Upon arrival at the airport, (in which we arrived 6 hours early for the flight as we were confused about the confirmation and to allow for any further flight time changes) we were told by a member of Bangkok Airways staff that our details were not even registered on their system and that we did not have a confirmed flight. This lead to a lot of stress as we had no confirmed flight for the evening and we had previous accommodation bookings in Koh Samui over the Christmas period. I have to now give credit to the Bangkok Airways staff who spoke with us at the airport because they dealt extremely well with the mistake made by Expedia and found us a new flight to go to Koh Samui that evening. However due to the lateness of our booking, this flight ended up costing us ?100.20 when the original cost around ?78.00. Therefore due to Expedia's mistake it not only encountered lots of unnecessary stress to our holiday, but also the loss of much needed funds when we assumed our flight had already been booked with them. We are travelling on a tight budget and as you can see the figure we paid is considerably more than what we had previously booked.On top of this mistake made by Expedia, we were outraged to receive a further email from them on the morning of the 21st at 03:29 (The day after the scheduled flight) stating that our flight had been cancelled. Fortunately we had already made it to our destination of Koh Samui by this point. During our trip, we have used many different booking companies successfully and are disappointed and shocked that such an established company can be so negligent towards their customers. We have complained to Expedia and expect a apology from them and a full explanation as to why our flight was first not confirmed, then changed, then cancelled - the day after we were due to fly! Thankfully, Bangkok Airways staff have such a high level of customer service and we made it to our destination on time.Reference: Expedia Itinerary number 110409933001Expedia Booking number 40CYGW"

Not the company they once were
","I have used Expedia on many occasions and over many years, with little or no problems ever arising. However - we recently booked return flights to Tenerife, along with 'low rate' FREE CANCELLATION car hire. On arrival at Gatwick check-in desk - we were informed that the dedicated seats we had reserved through Expedia, were not actually available and that we would be sitting individually about the plane. We were also informed, that we didn't appear at all, on the return flight passenger list. These 'issues' resulted in us spending 15-20 minutes at the check-in desk.On arrival in Tenerife, we were told by GOLD CAR hire company, that we would HAVE to acquire daily excess cover, amounting to more than double the initial car hire fee, unless I agreed to them taking in excess of ?2000 off my debit/credit card. It specifically states on the Expedia site, that any excess fees payable, are optional and makes no mention that any car hire company, will demand a large down payment off your card. When I stated I wanted to activate my FREE CANCELLATION agreement, I was told it wasn't possible and that my down payment would be kept.On returning back home from Tenerife - we were charged a further ?60 each (?180 in total) at the check-in desk, as our luggage quota, had somehow changed, from that we had flying out. When the stewardess asked us who we had booked our flights with - she held her head, sighed and said that she had experienced numerous problems over the months, with Expedia customers. She stated, to avoid future problems arising - ALWAYS use the official website of the airline you're travelling with. Trying to contact and speak directly, with any Expedia personnel, is also a trial. Clearly, it's operated from an Indian call-centre, where every other agent is either called Dave or Steve. (Or similar)Needless to say - I will NOT be using EXPEDIA again in the future.Itinerary No. 19964376259Gold car rental confirmation no. 9063526"

A con and appalling customer service.
",I booked through Expedia after receiving a discount voucher which I was unable to use apparently because of small print. I contacted customer service with a complaint over 3 weeks ago but still have not received a reply to date. The hotel I booked was more expensive booked through Expedia than direct with the hotel. The service I have received has been absolutely appalling and I will never use or recommend Expedia in the future.

Terrible Customer Care
","We booked flights to Australia with Expedia to join the rest of my family to see my unwell grandma over New Year's. Despite speaking to agents on several occasions prior to confirmation, our first names were missed off the tickets and only told by the airline that this was the case when attempting on-line check in. Complete lack of clarity in the booking system meant that had we not tried on-line check in we would have only found out at the airport. The airline says that because we booked via Expedia only they can change it.We've made tens of calls to the Expedia customer service numbers and each time, we have to go through the whole story again. We're expected to wait 3-5 days for a response that never seems to come. We've been told we'll get a call back with more information and still nothing. Not even an attempt at helping us and the flight is getting ever closer. It's getting too late to make alternative arrangements and we're at a total loss as to what can be done - no options except to cancel the flight, lose the money and lose the opportunity to travel given by Expedia. They have provided no information on how this could happen and side step simple questions by repeating their standard lines to us. Totally inhuman, unfair and infuriating attitude towards customers. Would have been far simpler and safer to book directly."

Poor system of booking and reluctant to answer complaints
","I booked a stay in a small b&b and gave Expedia my debit card details on the understanding that no charges would be made until we had checked in.On arrival at the b&b we were asked to pay the agreed charges for our stay.We refused on the grounds that we expected Expedia to debit our account.Later, the owner agreed that she would be able to get her money from the agent. But some weeks later she again said would we pay her by cheque.We contacted Expedia who asked for an itinerary number.

Dreadful!
","Booked a hotel through expedia, and pre-paid believing it would save hassle. How wrong was I.Ended up organising an early departure from the hotel due to issues with the place itself (how it got it's rating I really don't know), after notifying Expedia of what I was doing.  The hotel were happy to refund the extra night that was being dropped from the booking, but as others have said, you had to go through Expedia.  They they supposedly had difficulty contacting the hotel (not sure who I believe on this), and then finally told me the hotel said we had booked out AFTER the time I said - and so no refund due. Interesting, as the hotel paperwork and my credit card statement prove my version of events.Short version: Avoid, don't give them any money, don't trust their promises of call backs (never happens), and make sure you book with a credit card!I've now put this matter into the hands of my credit card company in the hopes of getting some of the money back, but we shall see. Ironically even my hotel review hasn't even been posted onto their site. Guess they want to help them keep their rating.Itinerary #19992415393"

Disgusting Customer Service. Horrendous Company
","I tried to book a flight online, it said there was an error and to try and book again in a couple of minutes so that's what I did. It then displayed the same message so I thought I'd call and book instead. So hopefully third time lucky but no. The flight was available but there was an error with booking with Bangkok Air so I was told to call back in a couple hours. So I called and attempted for the fourth time to book my flight. 2 tickets from Bangkok to Koh Samui one way on 28th December 2015. There was still an error with booking with the airline so tile again to all back. I called and we tried for the fifth time and still no luck. So one last time they tried and they said they couldn't book it due to there being an error with my bank card. So the flight was available still but I had to call my bank. I assumed it was due to us trying to purchase five times before and those not going through so the bank had declined a further purchase. I was then told to call Bangkok Airway myself and book the same flight. I called my bank to find that five flights were pending in my account and I had no money left or available for me to use. The bank gave me the authorisation codes for those payments and I was to give them to Expedia to fax back this information with a letter headed paper and my details and they would refund immediately. So I call Expedia. They say it will take 72 hours to refund money that they say they did not take however I had no access to it back into my account. And the flight refund, which was charged separately, I'd have to contact Bangkok myself to get a refund. They left me with no money what so ever and no flight so I requested he money be put back in my account just as quick as they took it. After way too much time on the phone I was finally out through to Sanjid Khan the customer service manager in banglor. Over 70 minutes I spent on the phone and finally we had agreed the refund would be in my account before the end of the day, my phone calls reimbursed and the flight paid for as good will. I wanted him to call back. He was very very unhelpful. Over 70 minutes to finally agree that is get my money back. So that evening came and no refund and no call back. I call in and they can't put me through to Sanjid and again told I would be called back within 24 hours. So a manager which apparently was the last point of call did not call back nor did he call back after I called in within 24 hours so I called again the very next evening. Borrowed money for my child's birthday cake and things as it was her birthday and they as a company nearly ruined it. As I had no money available in my account. I was put through to Sheila Anthony who was again a customer service manager and last point of call. Taking nearly an hour again we finally agreed she would send the fax to my bank with the authorisation codes and it would be refunded immediately. With regards to being reimbursed for phone calls that not possible nor where they going to compensate me in any way. It took for me to break down in tears before she went away and said they could offer me ?100 off a holiday package. Which would have been no use to me as I was only booking a one way flight. I got my refund immediately. And a voucher but I'm still not happy. My friend tried to then book the flights three times as I didn't have then, the funds back. She is now in the same situation I started off in so countless calls to make to get her money back and book the flight. This is the only website that has a flight available for us so we still wanted to book. I guarantee she will have the same bad service trying to get her money back and the flight is apparently still available and it's an issue with Bangkok Airways. I would never recommend this company to anyone. They are unhelpful. In fact the service is horrendous. They have no care for any customers. They take your money for flights you haven't even booked and fail to keep you informed or even return calls. Managers have no authority to fix the problems. They do not deserve the titles. Sheila did finally help me. I doubt there is a Sheila in banglor though. I've never hated a company so much that I would ever feel to write about them and share my experience. Some of the staff were helpful they did what they could do but the rest. I'll never use them again. I would rather swim to the other side of the world then book a flight with them and give them my money"

Disgusting service
",I hired a car  to have for 1 week on the 14th November and there was nothing in the small print to say the company providing me the car would want to hold 1200 on a credit card. I hardly use my card so don't have this sort of limit on it so therefore had to cancel my reservation after travelling to pick up the car. I wasted money on transport there and back just because they were not clear on the booking. I phoned Expedia immediately and the car company spoke to them on the phone to confirm I did not go ahead with my booking and was okay to refund me in full. Today after many phone calls I'm still waiting on my refund. I keep getting told that it will be processed and will receive within 7 working days and a confirmation email will be sent. This has never happened and I'm beginning to wonder what is really going on here and now read reviews from other sites saying people have waited months for their money back. This is not good enough and will be seeking advice on this as disgusting they are just saying the same thing every time I call and will not help you. Stay clear I will say people this rings alarm bells!! Get your act together Expedia or lose a lot of customers! You cannot treat people this way!!Intinery number #7146433223482

Didn't get what we paid for and no response from expedia
","EDIT: Added itinerary at endHistory: We had a previous very poor experience with expedia and with a greal deal of trouble got it sorted out and acceptable compensation (We received a voucher as part of the compensation for the issues we had which seemed fair. We were going to manchester three weekend ago and were going to stay in a cheap hotel but instead decided to upgrade to a good hotel and to book a small suite there to make it special and to use the voucher to pay for part of it.Note that without the voucher we would not have chosen to stay in the hotel we did so we spent more of our money in addition to the voucher than we would have other wise have done so.When we got to the hotel we were told that the suite wasn't available and we'd need to take a standard room. We didn't have much option so we took the standard room. The room was nice enough but not the special suite we booked (and paid for) and not what we would have chosen if we'd not gone for the suite using the voucher (We would have gone somewhere cheaper).The hotel told us they would send us a voucher as compensation. I had expected that it would be at least a refund of the expedia voucher we had spent, which I think was the least we could expect. However we received a voucher for the hotel chain and it wasn't enough to pay for another night at a hotel with them. So I don't really consider this suitable compensation.We'd paid for a room and they did not provide what we booked so I think it would be acceptable to get a refund in case or at least a refund of the expedia voucher which I feel we didn't get any benefit from spending. I would be willing to return the hotel voucher if I got more suitable compensation.I've put in a complaint to expedia but all I've had back is an automated reply saying it might take them a month to look at our complaint. I don't think this is reasonable. They should be able to deal with this quicker than that, and I've not got a lot of confidence now that I'll hear anything at all, or that it will be too late to investiagte by the time they get around to it.I've tried calling but either waited for half an hour in telephone queues before being disconnected or the one time I got through I explained the problem only to get disconnected.Basically all the same things that happened when I tried to resolve the issue that I had that lead to this voucher in the first place.Not at all happy at the moment. I feel like we spent our money/compensation through them, and didn't get at all what we paid for and now we are being ignored.I had hoped for a better experience after my previous one but I'm rather disappointed now.Itinerary #19735308227"

No contact from Expedia
","We operate a small Bed and Breakfast property in Australia.Over past 7 months have repeatedly tried to email Expedia to get our property listed with them.Not once have we heard back from them even though we're listed on booking.com for 7 months.Our advice to holiday makers is do your homework using these accommodation websites but, if possible, book directly with the airlines or directly with the accommodation websites.We are running a business and our reputation is important to us. We respond to customers promptly and don't screw up bookings plus the price is usually cheaper as we can avoid paying the agency commission so the guest gets a better price.Also if your credit card is overcharged or the booking goes wrong (through no fault of yours), we suggest you contact your bank and lodge a ""credit card dispute"". Your bank's credit card (transactions) section can investigate the matter. Make sure you do this as quickly as possible as there is usually a time limit to lodge the dispute.Most hotels do do the right thing and are honest but we have found Trip Advisor to be dishonest and the reviews to be fake or untrue on numerous occasions. We don't trust them or Paypal and think there is a conspiracy going on with some of these companies.If they don't list their address, email address or phone number then be wary as this is done so they can't be sued. Then they have nothing to lose when people lose their money. We are aware that TA accepts payments for negative reviews to 'disappear' from public view."

Appalling.......never, ever again
","Utterly appalling service for a trivial refund. Booked a Holiday Inn Express through Expedia, total around ?200. One of the 2 nights was awful and I complained to the hotel in the morning. They readily offered to refund the 1 night's stay (around ?90), but it would have to go via Expedia, as I booked via them. Initial request for refund from Expedia illicited a ""standard form"" email that it'd take them 28 days to even look into my refund request. I chased via email, chased again, chased again, cc'd in the Chief Exec and the MD of Expedia (no response!), chased again, chased again.........nothing but auto email responses or +1 hour waits in call queues). I double checked with Holiday Inn Express that they'd processed the refund their end - they confirmed they'd done it the same day I complained, so clearly Expedia had the money? Some 40 days later I finally got a response from an Expedia person (in some very far away call centre) apologising and confirming the refund plus a ?50 Expedia voucher (which is valueless as I wouldn't use them again if they were the last booking company on earth). My experience involved ?100. It was hardly going to break the bank. But I completely, 100% totally would NOT use Expedia, or trust Expedia, if I were spending ????'s on a holiday. There are far, far better companies out there. Expedia, you are an utter shambles."

Absolutely shameful
","Booked flights and hotel rooms for a stag trip in March. A month later Expedia emailed to inform me that the airline (Iberia) had changed their schedule, extending our stopover in Madrid from 2 hrs to 8hrs. Obviously this wasn't the fault of Expedia and I got in touch to investigate my options.Annoyingly Iberia wouldn't give me any other flight, so I was left with no choice but to book alternative flights, only 1 month away from our trip (again, I do not blame Expedia for this).However, the customer service experience was painful. A call centre in the far East, where nobody was interested. A simple request to tell me the separate costs of the hotel and flights took 1.5hrs on the phone. It then took me numerous conversations to cancel the flights but keep the hotel booking, and was assured of a refund for the flights... in 90 days!It is now 5 months later and I am still waiting for my ?1200 refund.

","I had a terrible experience with Expedia last year. They ""passed on"" my booking to a third party which I didn't know about until it all went wrong. Eventually I got connected to an Expedia telephone operative in Greece. When I questioned her about the problem I was fobbed off and told to contact the 3rd party booking agent. I asked her something like this....""aren't you are supposed to tell your customers the truth""? She answered ""No"".In the end the hotel which I booked ""through"" Expedia, resolved the problem.

//** Lunacy. Totally Unacceptable experience with cancellation & Customer Service team
","We booked a vacation package itinerary  110258330766  yesterday (26/11/15) however within the hour we realised that we had to cancel for personal reasons so we called up at 5.30 pm ( 1 hr after booking the package with you). We called the customer service number displayed on your website 0330 1231235 & 02030 248211. We were advised by an automated service that there was a high number of calls but they wait time was 30  min so we waited. We followed the procedure for cancellation and were put on hold for a total of 3.5 hrs yesterday evening. The longest being my partner that was on hold for 1.5hrs in one go trying to get through to the customer service line to cancel the holiday. After being on hold for such extreme lengths of time on both our mobile phones I made a call to the bookings line ? knowing that as with any company they are quick to take your money but less likely to refund/ give back . my call was answered on the 2nd ring and when I told the man that I really needed his help to get through to the customer service team to cancel a booking he put said he will transfer me, I was then on hold for another 45 min! Not only was this extremely frustrating it was also not a great display of the customer service teams ?customer service? . my partner managed to call the bookings line again and asked for a call back and explained that we need to cancel a booking we had just made . The man said he would log this and that we will be called back this evening.  We never received a call back.See extract from your T&C on line- 3.5.3.1 CancellationRequests by the Customer for cancelling or changing a trip must be submitted by telephone by calling 0330 123 1235 (Calls to this number cost the same as calls to local rate numbers).  Such requests will be dealt with on behalf of the Suppliers concerned.In the event of cancellation of the package holiday booking by the Customer, Expedia, Inc. and Supplier can require compensation to cover the costs of the travel arrangements already made. In addition to this, a standard cancellation charge may be made by the Suppliers of each element of the package holiday in respect of each cancellation. Where a cancellation affects more than one person on the booking a cancellation charge will be applied in respect of each person on the booking. My experience of Expedia so far hasn?t been great so I am very upset to be told this morning when we got through at 5.30am GMT that because we didn?t get through yesterday to cancel we would  not be able to cancel the flights. We would only be entitled to getting the accommodation, transfers and taxes reimbursed. I was very upset this morning after calling again to speak to the customer service team when they told me there?s nothing they can do, despite us following protocol. It was in fact the sheer volume of calls / lack of call taking staff available that was the reason we couldn?t cancel. I understand that the email option on your website says for ?non-urgent matters? so we chose to stick with the phone option to no avail so I feel I must now log an email to prove again that we have tried to get our package holiday cancelled. With any other industry there is a standard 14 day cooling off period. I am not sure why we have been subjected to a same day cancellation policy- without this rule being shown clearly online. How were we to know? misleading and devious at best. not what we are looking for in a luxury spend company.We would like to cancel and re-book a different holiday package with you but feel we can do this without this issue first being sorted. im aware the longer we wait the less can be done. I would like the think that a ?2500 holiday package of a life time, there would be some customer service and responsibility accepted by Expedia in tis situation where we have done physically all we can do. I can't see how we can stand to loose ?1600 (flight cost) because the customer service team did not answer the phone. this would not only a grossly unfair but also enough to put us and our family and friends off using Exepdia again - despite being long term users. Please can someone get back to me on an urgent basis to advise if this can be done. Thank you Harry Payne & Laura Gates****************************Since writing this post we been contacted by several helpful team members and promised a full refund. We have received our airport  transfer money back, but still waiting for the bulk of the ?2500  to arrive. we are asked to give 14 days which we will do. I will keep you all updated.**********************************UPDATE **I spoke with Expedia this morning. The hotel (?803) and the transfers (?115) have both been refunded and credited to my credit card. They advised that they would be refunding ?196 per passenger, which covers the tax paid on the flights. That would mean we lose about ?1,100 on the cost of the flights. This was NOT the conversation we had on the phone call a few weeks ago where we were promised a full refund. We were advised that the notes on the systems say that we were advised we would be given a 'partial refund'. I've told them that I was advised we would be given a full refund, not a partial refund - it's been escalated again and they will have to listen to the tapes and get back to me. They have given me the case number S-115556188  . I have also raised a complaint. Bl**dy Expedia. A call please ASAP to get this resolved before we consider suing for emotional distress, a case I am sure plenty others would join us in filing!!!!*********"

Dreadful
","Expedia took 11 months to process a refund. They had the nerve to say the refund was a ""goodwill gesture"". The reference number given was 17592001. The refund was due to the stopping of passenger duty on economy flights for children.  I was informed via email on 6th January that  Expedia ""will contact you as soon as we receive more information from them on their refund processes"". There has been no contact from Expedia unless I initiate it.I spent at least five hours chasing this. I called Expedia three times and emailed three times. I was promised call backs, nothing happened. I even called the airline and they said I had to do it through Expedia. The Expedia customer services lady I spoke to last night assured me she was going to send me further information. She hasn't. She told me that the refund was a goodwill gesture to save me waiting further. I question why, when I flew in August, and was in touch with Expedia as soon as I got back, the refund had not already been processed. The itinerary number is 17225885541"

unreliable and very poor customer service
","On 29/09/2015 I booked FlyNiki/AirBerlin flight for 2 people from Vienna to Barcelona via Expedia. Since I have not used FlyNiki/AirBerlin online booking before and the price on their site and on Expedia, which I was using many years for different travel arrangements, was the same, I decided to book the tickets rather via Expedia. What's a big mistake it proved to be.When booking tickets I double checked that the checked baggage is included in the price. However, when I got e-mail confirmation with booking code and I checked the flight on FlyNiki/AirBerlin site, I was surprise to see that the flight for both people was booked without baggage (JustFly). On top of that I found on my bank account a service charge 2 x 15? from Expedia about which I was not warn at all during booking. I also checked directly with the airline that the checked baggage is indeed not included. It was interesting to see on their page that the price difference between a ticket with and without checked baggage was just 15? (i.e. for two tickets that would be 30? as it was for service charge of Expedia). That looked quite suspicious.On 30/09/2015 I contacted Expedia customer service about that baggage problem. I was told that unfortunately they are not able to change my booking, but they advised me to pay for the baggagedirectly on airline page and to send invoice to them, which they will refund. I even got a confirmation e-mail from Expedia about it. The price for 2 baggages for outbound and inbound flights when bookedseparately was 103.20? which is much more than if booked directly with the flight. However, since I really needed the tickets with checked baggage and Expedia agreed to make a refund, I paid for it and forwarded my invoice to Expedia with an additional phone call to them as instructed to provide my card number details for refund. On 05/10/2015 Expedia confirmed that they will process my refund of 103.20? in 5-7 days. That did not happen, so I contacted them bye-mail on 13/10/2015. With some apology they promised to do it again in 5-7 days. Again nothing happened and by contacting them I received e-mail promising to send that refund on my account in 10-15 days.Because after 20 days there was no refund on my account, I contacted Expedia by e-mail again on 11/11/2015. Since then I have not received neither any answer from Expedia nor the promised refund. This indicates a very poor service of Expedia with their constant promises and no real action until they simply stopped responding at all. I am now being in the situation that I will need to proceed with a county court claim to retrieve the promised refund since I cannot find other way how to push Expedia to keep their promise.I am very disappointed with the service of Expedia which was before my preferable booking site for many years. Not any more.Itinerary 19786474379 - Case ID : [REQ:S-110912096]"

Misrepresentation
","My family recently booked a holiday through Expedia.  We always play tennis on holiday, and therefore specifically wanted a hotel with a tennis court, and  chose a hotel with ""tennis on site"".  After packing all of our equipment we were angry and upset to find there wasn't a court at the hotel or even in the surrounding area.  We contacted Expedia three weeks ago to raise this issue, but unfortunately have still not received a satisfactory reply. Unfortunately, I am now left with no choice but to take this up with the Advertising Standards Authority to try and receive some compensation.

Expedia ""Special"" Fares are misleading
","I booked a return flight from London to Bogota (itinerary No. 19920749792), in business class, in what was called an ""Expedia Special Fare"". It was clearly laid out that the fare is ""non-refundable, non transferable and name changes are not allowed."" Right above that, however, it says that ""We understand that sometimes plans change. We do not charge a cancel or change fee. When the airline charges such fees in accordance with its own policies, the cost will be passed on to you."" I have called to make a change and - surprisingly - are told by the agent that NO changes can be made to the booking, not even paying a change fee. That was not disclosed appropriately at the time of the booking and I would have otherwise booked on the airline directly as the fare difference was only a few pounds difference. Expedia UK's customer service is absolutely terrible, takes over half an hour to get someone on the phone. I am absolutely disappointed as I have been using Expedia USA for many years. I now have to try and file a lawsuit if I want to get some form of solution. It's ridiculous."

Shocking customer service
","I booked a hire car from Avis / Budget when I flew to Faro in September. When I got to the Avis / Budget desk, they told me that Expedia hadn't paid enough for the car that had been ordered, and I had to pay a further ?80. After a few minutes argument with the desk clerk, it was obvious she had no authority to either waive the extra cost or get somebody who could. With my wife of 65, my daughter and husband and a baby of 2, there seemed little point in arguing, so I accepted the extra charge. After returning to the UK I contacted Expedia customer service (a misnomer, if there ever was one). Was told I'd be put through to some form of priority complaints department. I was told nothing could be done over the phone and I should send copies of the relevant paperwork to an email address I was given. I did this, and got a standard response saying they'd look into it and I could expect a response within 28 days. (I wonder how long it take to progress non-priority complaints.) I've still not had a response other than a further request for the paperwork and an automated email whenever I chase them up. Its now over 60days since my initial complaint, and I've yet to hear anything of substance. It's perhaps worth mentioning that I've been using Expedia almost since it first started up and have made many business trips with them; all without a hitch. However, the first time there's a problem, the ability to respond effectively is shocking. I rate all companies by how well they perform when things go wrong. Any bunch of incompetents can look good when things go smoothly. How a company deals with problems sorts out the men from the boys.Reference Number: 17265163 (ref: 17265163) / Itinerary 18861646865 -  Case ID : [REQ:M-12013307]"

Charged Twice for flight and still no response from Expedia
","On the 20th September I booked a holiday to Dubai over the telephone for our family of 5 to fly out on the 20th October. Within half an hour of booking the holiday I realised that I had made an error in that I could not fly out on that date due to an important work presentation which had been allocated to me at short notice. The advisor cancelled my flight and arranged for me to fly out on the following evening. I had to pay ?594.70 for my Emirates ticket as the price had gone up from ?472.70 within half an hour ! When I tried to log onto Emirates to view my flight I realised that Expedia had made an error and spelt my surname incorrectly. They had spelt it correctly on my hotel reservation. I rang Expedia on the 9th October to request that they correct my surname. After 2 very long phone calls and being put on hold for over an 1 hr on each occasion I was informed that the surname was corrected and I received an apology. I received my Barclay Card statement on arrival back from Dubai to find to my horror that Expedia had charged ?607.90 to my Barclay Card on the 9th October when I had only rang to get my surname corrected !  Since then I have emailed Expedia on numerous occasions. My last email was on the 31st October and I received acknowledgement but so far no reply. I have been charged twice for my ticket and I do not wish to pay late interest charges. Please could you get back to me asap. This whole experience has left me with very little confidence in booking with Expedia again due to appalling customer service. Case ID REQ 113026441IT number 19726122472UPDATE 26/11/15After I posted my review as above I received a phone call from an Expedia agent on the same day  who promised to get back to me as soon as possible regarding me being charged twice for my Emirates ticket.

Lucky escape. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is.
","I was foolishly going to book with expedia but luckily there were three things that stopped me.Firstly, when I was thinking about booking there didn't seem to be any way to book luggage with the airline. I was told that they would email me a link after payment. I was told the prices over the phone but it all seemed a little vague. I was speaking to an Indian call centre. I don't like to use companies with these call centres.I finally decided to book based on their excellent price but when I entered my card details it said that the price had increased by ?150. I'm sure this would be illegal under British law but they can do it because they have no presence here. I wasn't going to be treated like that so decided to think again. Whilst doing this I found the reviews on this site and they saved me from making a terrible mistake.I've now booked with a decent travel agent.Please don't think that the advertised price is the price you pay.

criminal to allow a company like this to operate.
",Booked a hotel in Puerto Pollensa with Expedia only to be phoned 3 days before flying and told that the hotel was fully booked. I paid extra for a balcony on the pine walk overlooking the sea. They said that they had booked me into a hotel very similar close by.what choice did I have? We ended up staying nearly a 40 minute walk from where we originally wanted to stay and my balcony with a sea view was now a ground floor apartment with a view of scrub land at the back of the hotel. I went and spoke to the original hotel we had booked and it was obvious that the booking had never been taken.  Expedia basically took my money knowing the booking would not be honoured. I obtained tariffs for the hotel we stayed in and it worked out ?300 cheaper than my original booking. Can I get hold of Expedia? I don't think so. I have tried countless emails but have only received automated responses.  It's nothing short of robbery. I will never use this company again and would advice friends and family not to either.

The Manila to boracay flight was cancelled on Saturday and so far over 4hrs on the phone and still they refuse to understand that they should deal with both rebooking both flights. Best option they've come up with so far is stranding us in Manila 2 days later and then we are on our own getting back to London. Refusing to help or understand the situation. Literally at the airport with no idea how/when we can get home! Can't even call it service and I will make sure no one I know books with them again."

Poor poor customer service!!
","I recently went on a holiday with my family to Athens. Unfortunately, the hotel we were originally meant to stay at decided to close for the off-season and so this resulted in a dialogue with the Expedia relocation team. After quite a few hours on the phone we were, at a greater cost, able to secure a reservation with another hotel. One week later, Expedia reservations team called to relocate me again because the second hotel had decided to close for renovation work. The third and final hotel at which we stayed refused to let us use the indoor swimming pool for free even though the Expedia customer service representative had told us this would be included at no additional cost. After some stress and negotiation during the holiday, Expedia advised us to pay for the use of the indoor pool (?25 per adult and ?12.50 per child) and to email them the receipt once we had paid. Holiday is now over and the receipts have been emailed to Expedia and I am still waiting for the refund of ?212.15! When I call customer services, I am passed from one representative to another for at least 30-45 minutes and nobody is able to help me. Conveniently, the line keeps cutting before I can reach anybody competent enough to help. Surprise surprise there is no call back even though that is exactly what I am told will happen if the line gets cut. Can't imagine what the phone bill will look like but at this rate I would be happy enough just to receive the refund. Itinerary number is 19839757752."

Basically all I have had is automated replies. This has now escalated to me having 2 problems, one with a failed transfer and now a problem with Expedia, no resolution for 2 months.Such a shame as I really cannot use them again and I used to tell all my friends how wonderful they were.My advice to others is small claims is simple and easy to use, sadly forme it is now really worth it for ?30.

If I could give zero stars I would!
","All I can say is that Expedia have delivered the worst customer service I have ever experienced in all my travels, they do not listen and treat us with utter contempt. Don't even bother with their complaint process as they don't follow it................read on. I booked a hotel in Manchester for my wife and I back in January, the rate advertised was B&B but when the confirmation came through it stated room only. It took several weeks to resolve the amendment as no one in their customer service call centre had a clue how to sort it. When I finally managed to sort the problem (4 months later I might add) I raised a formal complaint in line with the process on their website. I heard nothing, several emails and weeks later I decide to escalate the matter to Stuart Newman who is Expedia's Director of Customer Experience. I had seen him respond to previous complaint on Trustpilot so thought he would take this matter seriously and at least make some effort to help. I sent him at least 5 emails and also asked him to call me.......as suspected I heard nothing. Obviously a made up name then!I then get a call from some chap in the USA who offers me some compensation and the offer of a full and comprehensive report into the issues I have raised 5 months previous. Guess what.......no report has ever materialised and having chased this every 2 weeks for at least 3 months they have now told me they will no longer communicate with me on this matter! There was never a report it was just another way to keep me hanging on, what a waste of time.In all honesty my issue was never about the refund (we are only talking ?32 here), it was all about the appalling level of customer service I received that spoilt my trip and caused no end of problems. Want some advice, avoid using this company at all costs. If you have cause to complain they will not deal with it, they will fob you off and then just stop communicating all together. I for one will never use this company again.....and don't send anything to Stuart Newman as he wont reply, that is assuming of course that he actually works there!"

3 Months and over ?100 in phone calls for a refund that has not arrived yet
","Let me start this properly. First impressions last. Do. Not. Book. With. Expedia.I had trouble with my flight and had to change a minor detail (my first name had a letter missing) and I thought to be safe, I would rather not risk it at the airpot and so I got it changed. Expecting it to be seemless, quite clearly I thought wrong.I spoke on the phone and they told me they couldn't refund it as credit and provide the changed ticket on that. Instead I had to purchase another ticket and wast told I would recieve a refund. A month later I called for about 20 minutes, they refused to believe me when I told them I had not received it. I called again, around once a week to keep chasing up and get me ?300 refund for a single ticket. It took 3 months before I received an email with ""refund reciept confirmation"" dated a month back. Despite this, I still have NOT received the refund!The call charges are absurd, having over an hour its racked up some crazy amount over ?100 and now I'm out of money, time, and patience. The call centres are indian and keep you on hold for so long, they hope to get you off the phone as they charge a ridiculous amount per minute.I still haven't even recieved my refund for something 3 months ago. They keep telling me I will receive it and now they keep telling me I HAVE received it! My bank confirms that the company has not provided me any money, so I asked if any of the exact amount of money refund had arrived (refund may be under a different company name I thought) and again, no.They only care about taking your money. If nothing goes wrong you will be fine, but when you are paying over ?500 to go somewhere for a week you want to ensure your safe. Expedia is the complete opposite of safe! Don't buy through them again!!!Original itinerary number: 19449824911Purchase:TripDate of refund: 18/10/2015Yours sincerely,A one-time customer."

Appalling customer service
","8 weeks ago I booked a short holiday in Kephalonia through Expedia. I did a lot of research and booked a hotel that give us exactly the kind of break we wanted. Less than a week before the departure date an Expedia employee called and told me that the hotel had overbooked so I needed to book somewhere else there and then. I wasn't in a position to do any such thing at the time and told him so. I called my partner and asked her to call him back and find out what was going on. She called him and tried - for over an hour - to get a replacement hotel. She explained exactly what our requirements were and he gave her a couple of suggestions - she wasn't able to access the website at the time - and told her to take it or leave it; they had already cancelled our original on our behalf! She chose a hotel as prompted and, when we got there, found it to be the total opposite of what we wanted. Not by the beach but up a mountain, not in a town but on its own in the middle of nowhere, not close to other towns/ beaches but a good half hour away from anywhere.I filed a complaint upon our return and expected a response within the stated 48 hours. I heard nothing for 28 days. I re-submitted the complaint and followed up with a call to customer services. The call was 25 minutes of rote responses: we don't have another number you can call, there is no named manager you can speak to, there is no postal address, I will 'expedite' a response by emailing the complaints department. He told me that they would respond by Monday - 120 hours away! What happened to the 48 hours? Monday came and went. Another email sent.The email recipient for Expedia.co.uk will not respond and Expedia do not take your complaint seriously - they don't take it at all!I GOT AN EMAIL FROM EXPEDIA  2 MINUTES AFTER THIS REVIEW WAS POSTED!! THEY OBVIOUSLY CARE ABOUT THE NEXT MUG PUNTER MORE THAN A FORMER ONE!My itinerary numbers were given to you on 28/9, 17/10, 28/10 and 2/11 in emails and on 28/11 by phone but, as you clearly send complaints straight to spam and your call centre workers cannot handle anything that deviates from their scripts, here they are again: 19674078442 and 7134904073649. The difference between the two itineraries will be obvious."

Ripped off. Misleading advertising. No response from Expedia
","Dear ^R. My itinerary number is 19910354968. I posted the complaint below on the 1 Nov 15.""I booked a hotel in Paris for my birthday with the family. I received a quote for two adults and two children including breakfast. Once I had paid the voucher said ""breakfast for two""  for the first time. I need to pay an extra 100 Euro's to feed the kids for the weekend. What a nasty birthday weekend surprise! Intentionally misleading customers and once you've paid the offering is reduced, what a way to run a business, not exactly ethical and intentional misrepresentation. False advertising to induce you into thinking that you get the full package. I am taking the matter further and despite asking for a response twice, all I get from Expedia is a resounding silence. I have lodged a complaint with the Advertising Standards authority. Next step small claims court if I am made to pay the additional cost . If you want to get ripped off use Expedia."""

Awful customer service!
",I recently made a hotel booking with Expedia only to discover a month later that they booked the hotel again and charged my card for a second time. I phoned immediately to discuss the matter and after over an hour on the phone I had sorted a refund but without an apology and without any acknowledgement of it being their responsibility. On the contrary I was made to feel as if the fault was mine. I then received an e-mail to say that my account would be credited with ?25 for the inconvenience that had been caused. I spent another 30 minutes on the phone sorting out this ?25. Today I tried to make a car booking and went to access the ?25 voucher to find that it wasn't there. I have just spent 40minutes speaking to 4 different people all of whom told me they'd transfer me to someone who could help to then only have to start the conversation all over again. I got no where in the conversation and was informed that the ?25 hadn't been credited and that it could only be used against a hotel booking! A complete joke!!

","If you like to use companies that offer good customer service then expedia is not for you.The contact us by email method is a total waste of time, as you dont get a reply (i sent two emails to them, no reply after a week from either)I then decided to call them (indian call centre), where the guy who answered my call just constantly talked over me and kept interupting while i tried to explain the issue.My advice would be for expedia to take some of that huge pile of money they have from spending peanuts on an indian call centre and invest in a bit of customer service training"

Expedia.....what a joke
","l have rang Expedia customer services 3 times from Spain. I booked a secret deal with free parking ref 19702060415?. When the hotel was revealed it didnt have free parking, I know this as I have stayed there twice before. I first rang on Wed 16th Sept 15 as soon as the hotel was revealed. Someone called back and said I would have a reply in between 24-72 hours. On Sat 19th, after the 72 hours had elapsed I rang again from Spain staying on the line 42 minutes when I was told I would have the reply within the next 24 hours...not good enough! The assistant didnt know who the ombudsman for the company is so I asked to speak to the supervisor. Paul Jacobs came on the line and agreed that although the secret deal had offered free parking, free parking isnt available at the designation hotel Deliox aqua centre Benidorm. Paul Jacobs promised he would ring me back with a solution within 4 hours that was over 6 weeks ago....again not good enough. I have a screen shot of the secret deal offered. I dont understand the problem, I entered into a contract with Expedia to supply free parking, they did not, this is misrepresentation. Although a secret deal is non refundable I would like a refund for two reasons. 1, I rang Expedia almost immediately and again three days later and after 3 expensive calls from Spain nobody has given me an answer. 2, I went onto their website when nobody rang back and booked another hotel ref. 19721618193, I offered to pay the difference when I spoke to their supervisor Paul Jacobs but he promised to ring me back within 4 hrs with a solution, that was over 6 weeks ago. I then had two bookings for Tuesday 22nd Sept 15. I know secret deals are non refundable but Expedia broke our contract. l am looking for a refund of 280.90 GB Pounds for the first booking 19702060415 and ?45.49 in phone calls from Spain to the UK Call centre. 3 days after l arrived home Expedia offered to pay for parking at the first hotel.....All too little far far too latel have taken this up with ABTA and now 1 month later they tell me Expedia are not an ABTA member so looks like l will have to issue a claim in the small claims court."

Expedia Nightmare
","Booking my holiday with Expedia has been the most miserable experience.I booked a package deal with Expedia.co.uk in August for a 3 night stay in the Czech Republic including the flight out and the flight back. Itinerary# 19383768372.At Gatwick airport I was denied boarding at the airline check in desk for my outward flight DESPITE having a VALID European Union passport and meeting all the conditions of travel. Thus making my ?167.18 cost of the package a total waste of money.I contacted Expedia customer support on the 20th August by phone and the person I spoke with was aggressive and argumentative.I e-mailed Expedia on the same date but did not receive a reply to my complaint and request for a refund.I again e-mailed Expedia on the 1st October and finally got a reply on the 12th October in which my complaint had not been understood or had been deliberately dismissed without being addressed.I e-mailed Expedia on the 16th October specifically detailing this, only to get a reply on 22nd October which again has not addressed my complaint.Expedia refuses to refund me my measly ?167 or offer me any compensation.In my opinion Teresa Day of the Customer Relations Department at Expedia.co.uk should consider resigning from her post if this is the best service she can provide to customers of ExpediaFollowing this review I did receive a very polite apology on the phone from Expedia. However Expedia.co.uk will still not refund my measly ?167. I would URGE Teresa Day of the Customer Relations Department at Expedia.co.uk in the light of my experience with Expedia.co.uk and the multitude of negative reviews recently featured on Trustpilot to SERIOUSLY consider her RESIGNATION during the next 48 hours.In my opinion I cannot see a long term future for Expedia.co.uk in the travel business as it is presently being operated.

","I booked two hotel rooms for a trip to the USA from 14th to 19th September, and pre-paid for the entire stays before leaving on the trip. When I returned home, and received my credit card bill, I had been charged again by the hotel, leaving me almost ?1000 out of pocket.As this is my company credit card, for which I am responsible, I have now had to pay this bill, and over a month after the money was taken, I am still struggling to get any answer out of Expedia, except the usual ""We are working on it, and it will take up to 28 days to get it sorted"" rubbish.As it currently stands, I have sent 6 e-mails, and spent about 2 hours on the phone trying to get my money back, and am 15 minutes into yet another phone call to see what I can do to get it moved along.This is truly woeful customer service, and represents the end of my customer relationship with Expedia. If everything goes right for you when booking/travelling, they are fine to deal with, but if it goes even slightly wrong, then good luck, as you will surely need it.Edited for Expedia.Itinerary Number 19677661594.

Possibly the worst customer service in the UK
","When their website is working clickety click and you can print your docs and go on holiday ok well and good and in the past has worked well for us.However recently their website seems to have been having problems and failing at the transaction stage leaving you unsure whether you have paid? or your holiday booked? Then you descend into the hell hole of their customer service which has been the worst customer service from any company that I have ever experienced.The operatives of that customer service seem to lack a grasp of the English Language or understanding of a customers predicament and that is after you have waited 45minutes to speak to a human being,basically they seem to want to just get you off the phone as quickly as possible.They then refer you to another department which of course you have to re dial and wait again and this number turns out to as useless as the first.They tell you to email but no one responds to your email.You phone again now getting a bit cross with the ongoing situation they assure you they will phone back within 48 hrs but again no one does phone back. We must have spent in total 3/4 hours with many phone calls and none of the call service agents seemed to have the ability to authorise  anything. For a multi million pound company their customer service is absolutely appalling and I will never use them ever again."

When it is good, it is very good, but when it is bad...
","I have used Expedia for years, and had some great holidays/flights/hotel bookings with no problems.  But wow, when there is a problem?  Any good feelings that you have about the company evaporate quicker than you can say ""we are experiencing a high volume of calls at present"".  Even when you personally have arranged with the hotel for a cancellation/refund,  trying to get Expedia Customer Service to process this correctly is extremely difficult.  I had to spend [no joke], a total of 3 hours on the phone and numerous emails to cancel the hotel booking, only to find out a week later that they had not cancelled the flights, despite a very long drawn out conversation and being put on hold whilst Customer Service cancelled said flights.  So all in all, one of the worst experiences I have encountered; Ryanair would have fared better.  So my advice is that if the booking is certain and there will be no changes, go ahead, it will be fine.  But be warned.  Any changes/cancellations/refund requests and suddenly blood from a stone would be easier."

Terrible Customer Service.
","I have booked two separate holidays this year and both have been charged incorrectly by Expedia. My first was to Crete and even though it was a packaged deal, the flights were not booked.  We spent 3 hours on the phone with Expedia trying to resolve this, we finally booked again having been then told that the price had now gone up - in the space of 3 hours!!!!! We didn't even bother trying to get a refund, way too much hassle. The second holiday I was overcharged for two flights. Expedia have claimed I was wrong, I sent statements. It is quite clear I have been overcharged. It's now been three weeks since I logged the complaint and all I get is ""this is being escalated internally"". It really should *not* be this hard. Absolutely disheartened by this whole experience. Doubt i will ever use Expedia again.*******************************************************In response to Expedia Response below.

Messed up, didn't rectify, ignored all correspondence
","I booked a package - flight, hotel, car - and found out by chance the day before I left that Expedia had failed to book the car.  I was not offered an alternative, I was not refunded the money already paid for several days, I was not even given the call back I was promised.  All subsequent emails were completely ignored.  This was a costly mess up for me - I had to find an alternative hire car, which of course cost more at that late stage.  It could have been a lot worse.  Expedia's lack of response indicates that this is a risk they expect customers to take.In response to Expedia I have emailed you three times and had no reply.

Flights and hotel without problem
","I found the cheapest flight option to be Expedia. The flight wasn't a direct one and the only issue I got was the check-in online but I don't think it was Expedia's fault. I got a confirmation email  minutes after I paid and everything was smooth.Same with the hotel booking, best price and Nectar points. Anyway I called the hotel to double check my reservation, that would be my advice when using third party booking services."

Poor customer service and no response from complaint
","Following making an additional activity booking for holiday transfers. I hadnt recieved the required information needed to arrange pick up time.

Don't book through Expedia!
","A few months ago I booked a holiday through Expedia to Bali, the flights with Etihad Airways.Problems arose when I arrived at Denpasar International airport on Friday 10 July for the return journey . A volcano had erupted in Java - all flights were cancelled and the airport was closing down.I contacted the Etihad office in Jakarta who booked me on a flight the following day, Saturday 11 July. When I asked if they could help with accommodation for the night I was bluntly told 'No'.After finding a hotel myself, I received an e-mail that night to say that the re-booked flight had also been cancelled and to contact the Etihad office. I tried several times to get through to the Etihad office in Jakarta unsuccessfully - I later discovered it had closed for the weekend.When I was unsuccessful in getting through to the Etihad office in Abu Dhabi, I contacted my son back in the UK for help.He contacted Expedia for help. They refused, saying it wasn't their problem.When he contacted Etihad in Manchester they informed my son that Flight EY7109 from Denpasar to Abu Dhabi had in fact departed and that I had been classed as a 'no-show'.I did not turn up for the flight on Saturday because I received an e-mail from Etihad saying that the flight had been cancelled.Even after I informed Etihad of the e-mail cancelling the flight no help was forthcoming.They also told my son that Denpasar airport would be closed until Tuesday - not true.By Sunday night, and no contact from Etihad, I asked my son to book me on any flight home.I am 65-years-old and was running out of medication for a heart complaint.At a cost of ?800 for the flight home, plus ?200 hotel bills and ?120 for incoming phone calls, a ?900 holiday cost me an extra ?1120 just to get home.After numerous e-mails to Etihad I eventually received ?800 compensation - the money I paid for the return flights.My son has contacted Expedia numerous times by e-mail and by phone. They never return calls and indeed refuse to give out their names.The moral of this tale is if you are going on holiday and want security and peace of mind, don't fly with Etihad and don't book through Expedia.FAO Expedia.co.uk: Booking number is 17879852472"

Book direct - save yourself the lies.
",False advertising rampant. The discounts they promise are all false. Check for yourselves by visiting the hotel websites directly and you will see what I mean - don't take my word for it.I would appreciate NO RESPONSE from Expedia Customer Services as I have already tried this route and been right to the top.

Expedia - Yet Again Appalling customer Service
","I find myself having to complain again about the poor, in fact non-existent after sales customer service from this online travel company.  When booking our holiday in June 2015 for travel in August 2015 we were supposed to receive 2000 Nectar Points within 30 days of our return.  Upon checking my Nectar account I found  no points had been added so we emailed Expedia who replied telling us they had been added.  We replied with screen shots of the account to prove that nothing has been added from Expedia.  They then replied saying they would reply within 3-5 working days.  This was 28 October 2015.  We never received a reply or the points.  We emailed again on 16 December 2015 and to this email have never even had an acknowledgement.  I cannot stress enough how angry I am with the way they treat people.  Just disgusting.  I will be pursuing this to ensure I receive the Nectar Points I am entitled to.The email response Case ID no is (REQ:M-11798876)Our Itinerary No was 19003822138First review:We booked our recent summer holiday through Expedia.co.uk as they had the best price for the holiday we were looking for.  From beginning to end the level of information and service was just atrocious.  The waiting times to the Indian call centres are just ridiculously long - on most occasions an hour or more at a time just in a queue!  Our flights with Ryan air had no option to add baggage so we called them and they told us the wrong fee for hold baggage.  You cannot add it at time of booking but have to book and pay and then go to Ryan air website and add baggage afterwards which incurs an extra ?5 per person fee because you didn't add it at time of booking and it was dearer than we were advised by Expedia.  We did manage to get the difference back from Expedia after a lot of phone calls and wasted time and energy.  They also charge a ?12 fee for paying with a debit card!  It says at time of booking that this is a charge from airline and they pass it on.  Once we had booked and then went to Ryan air website to add bags it clearly states that they actually discount for using debit cards!  We then went thought the whole process again with the phone calls and wasted time late into the night and got our ?12 refunded.  Beware they are underhanded and cannot be trusted.  All in all an absolutely appalling company to deal with who treat their customers with disrespect. The whole experience with Expedia was terrible and stressful and put a dampner on the run up to our holiday and I would never ever use them again even if they were the best price available.Our Itinerary No was 19003822138.  I'm sure nothing further will be done but I am still annoyed by the fact that we had to pay extra to buy our hold baggage just because Expedia's online booking system wont allow the simple task of adding baggage to your booking at time of booking!  This should be on their automatically. If other travel websites can manage then why cant you?  We were penalised and had to pay extra for hold baggage because of the incompetence of Expedia!"

Expedia booked the wrong accommodation in the wrong location
","I booked a hotel with Expedia. The name, photos, description and location clearly stated it was for this particular hotel. On checking in I was told that there was no reservation. I checked the confirmation and reminder and they all confirmed that I was at the right hotel. I showed this to the hotel manager but he said Expedia had not booked a room at the hotel and that the hotel was fully booked. I contacted Expedia and they told me I was at the right location. The hotel manager said the chain had apartments in a different location and he would check and see if Expedia had booked these. The hotel manager printed the reservation from Navarino Services who work on behalf of Expedia. It clearly stated that the reservation was for a 4 bed apartment (there were 2 of us) at a completely different location in an apartment. Expedia had completely Mis-sold this accommodation. The photos used were for a hotel, promising a restaurant and bar. The photos on the website were from the hotel and the location was in a completely different area. After 9 phone calls the hotel manager called round every hotel in the area and found 1 room for us. He spoke to 5 different Expedia employees on our behalf explaining the problem they had called. Expedia didn't care, they told me they could move us to a motel and we would have to pay the bill not them. I had proof Expedia made this error and not one person apologised. After 4 hours on the phone to them which I can prove we were moved to a new hotel.  When I returned from this awful experience I then received an email from Expedia asking whether I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Unbelievable. Not one apology nothing. I certainly won't be using Expedia ever again and won't be recommending them. It. 197429922822"

Promoted dodgy hotel, charged for a stay I didnt make and hides behind Offshore call centres
","Had a really bad experience when on a business trip in London. Hotel claimed not to have a note of my reservation. Was on the phone to Expedia relocation for over 2 hours while standing around street corners in London. Cut off twice and spoke to numerous unhelpful staff. Ended up being offered a stay in another hotel - one with an awful tripadvisor rating and seemingly owned by the same people as my original booking, so quite obviously a scam (overbooking best rated hotel to transfer people into dives). Finally gave up and went home. Despite taking my money, Expedia are quite happy to expect me to wait 28 day for them to respond to my refund request.

Rubbish customer service still no email reply about complaint
","I have now sent two emails but have not had one response from anyone:I would like to put forward my experience from hell that I have had to endure from your company from the first minute of the booking.  A booking was made by myself Aqib Shakil through your well-advertised so called company Expedia but i did not imagine this awful experience.First booking was made over the phone where all my details were taken by one of your advisors except my email address where at this point the call got disconnected. Nobody called back however payment had been deducted from my card. I called back to confirm the booking but there was no reservation and kept getting transferred to different advisors and got cut off again. After 5 and a half hours after speaking to one of the customer service agents he managed to give me my reservation number. We then went to the hotel, firstly there was no lift which I did request the advisor, I told the Agent who  first took payment that, I have a person  with me who has a disability and I will bring him from hospital and is taking medication since he has stitches in his  stomach he is unable to walk, we collected our keys and first find out there is no lift, this was meant to be a hotel and we were sent up 5 floors on massive stairs in to an old LOFT, it  was an absolute trash, the beds were bent (broken from the middle), the mattresses were in bad shape, there was so much cold air coming inside, there was no private bathroom as we had requested for the gentleman with the illness and it was a shared toilet by the whole floor, the shower was a plastic box which looked like a big garbage bin with no front cover or any privacy what so ever, there was no heating inside the room it felt like I  was living in a 1966 hospital.We then went away in the car on the phone to  one of your agents and explained the situation the call got disconnected 2 times before speaking to another gentleman Ninesh from the customer support team after spending two and a half hours  he said we have a hotel in Luton only with one room available you can take that but you have to make payment of ?125 for now and once we investigate I will get you a full refund and I can get compensation since I was in a terrible position because of the ill patient I had to pay the money. We had to travel 40 Miles from the location. We arrived at the hotel at 2am and gave the reference number to the receptionist named ALI, he said we have been overbooked we have no rooms available. After all that travelling its 2am at night and we have no room again being let down and the patient was not in a position to move around, the hotel manager spent 1 hour finding a hotel nearby and there was nothing available. At this point I then called Expedia again speaking to an agent explained the situation and the call was disconnected again. I then rang again spent two hours on the phone and your agent then finds me a room all the way back in London which means I had to travel another 40 miles  again at 4am at night.I then arrived at this hotel and the receptionist said the payment has not been made therefore we need to speak to Expedia once the payment is made we will give the key. I had to call Expedia again and they made payment I got the room keys at 5am in the morning.I was told I will receive a call within 72 hours with a result of the complaint, however I allowed a full week but did not get a response so I gave a call on 29/09/15, I spoke to your colleague and she said there has been one refund initiated for ?75 for the first hotel and for the second refund and compensation I need to send an email. I was not happy with this so I spoke to the supervisor named Paul and he said he only has control refund ?50 for the full refund of both hotel costs and compensation  I need to send an email and this will get sorted. I would like a full refund for both hotels,I believe I have been given the first refund as Expeida has admitted liability that it was the fault of the agent, however I am not still happy with this as I have suffered a large loss, never went to sleep, had to drive around all day to different locations, on the phone to your agent for nearly the whole day, I had a patient who was falling asleep all over the place due to the antibiotics he had taken, I have been treated very unfairly and I felt at one point that I am not even being treated as a human. I spent neally ?36 on my phone bill, spent ?60 on fuel.I would like a full refund of the hotel and compensation for my loss of time and expenses suffered due to Expedia. I have given the hotel details below;ITIN: 19734062039- FIRST HOTELITIN: 19744595361- SECOND HOTELReservation for the third hotel- 160092Finally got sorted thanks for my refund mani"

Poor customer service: refund still awaited
","We booked a hire car from San Francisco airport in August via Expedia.co.uk. My partner's credit card was debited with the amount straight away. When we went to pick up the car, the US car hire company (Alamo) told us that they were unable to honour the booking as my partner didn't have a valid British driving licence, but a US one, and that invalidated our booking. We then had to book a car from scratch with them, at a higher cost, and had to pay for this, in addition to what we had already paid Expedia.As soon as we got back to the UK (10th September) we contacted Expedia with all the information and the credit card statement showing that we had been charged twice. I also complained that nothing on the Expedia website mentioned having to hold a valid UK driving licence only and that US driving licences were not acceptable.I have chased this up several times but have only had vague emails telling me that they had a large volume of emails to deal with. Expedia owes us ?240 for this double booking. I'm currently unemployed and could really do with this money. I was initially told my complaint would be addressed within 28 working days. We're now almost a month later and I've heard nothing concrete about the issue, or confirmation that the refund is being processed. For info, our CRD Reference Number is 16317151/itinerary #7129955658322.Update 13 October 2015: STILL NO RESPONSE FROM EXPEDIA, NOR REFUND, NOR EXPLANATION!!Update 20 October 2015: despite Expedia responding very quickly to my post saying they would look into it, and a phone call from me chasing things up, and being told this would be 'escalated' I'M STILL WAITING FOR A RESPONSE. This is unacceptable. I raised this complaint on 10th September and am expecting a refund of ?240!"

IGNORE THE PRICE MATCH GUARANTEE!!!
","Booked 3 nights on the Sunborn Gibralter 6 - 9 Nov with Expedia.  No breakfast, double room and no cancellation. ?491.Noticed a deal on Amoma.com  for ?384 with breakfast, double room and cancellation option.Decided to apply for Expedia's Price match Guarantee.  Jumped through all the hoops they wanted only to be told my booking did not exactly match the Amoma booking.  I asked in what way.  Was told no room type was on the screen shot I had sent.  Told them it was on there and it was a double room and to check again.Once they had check they then decided it was because my booking did not mirror the Amoma deal in that breakfast was being offered by Amoma and they felt ""we had offered you better value that Amoma"".I asked in what way was Expedia's booking better value than Amoma particularly the fact I was getting breakfast for a lower price than Expedia offered.  They just repeated it didn't mirror the Expedia price therefore the price match couldn't be done.The Price Match is a completed farce.  It would be interesting to know if anyone ever gets it.  Sure it is false advertising.  Would love to know who I could approach to look into this.I will never book with Expedia again.  They lie.My Itinerary number is 19755668255  My case id is 11636467"

The worst holiday booking I have experienced.
","From start to finish the holiday could have been a total nightmare, however due to persistently contacting them (waiting for almost an hour in some cases) I was able to get what I wanted, but no one should have to work so hard to book a holiday in this day and age. Some of the people I spoke to seemed to know what they were talking about, others didn't have a clue, every time I made contact I was told the same things despite telling them I had already had those conversations with someone previously. Worst of all not returning calls when promised, that is not acceptable. And finally making complaints which are not even acknowledged. Suffice to say I will never use this company again."

I do not think that Expedia should be a trusted Visa merchant
","An awful experience that left my bank account nearly ?11,000 out of pocket  due to Expedia earmarking funds on my account for duplicated entries for aborted flight bookings  (error message #1.92ff4317.1443604687.df51baf)After failing to provide a single booking (even after multiple tries by Expedia  agents to book) Expedia passed entries to my bank account for every try. They then, once notified of the error, they failed to provide a timely fax to release the requests for the money they had asked to be earmarked on my accounts/cards for failed tries. The fax needed was requested by my bank in order to remove the many duplicate charges that resulted from no finalised purchases and the remedy could have been completed on the day of the error but was not because Expedia did not provide the fax.Furthermore, on the day of trying to book I easily purchased the flight I wanted direct from BA whilst Expedia was showing increasing charges. I do not therefore believe that Expedia necessarily find the cheapest flights. BEWARE - you must go to the airlines direct !!Last week  I received no useful replies from e mails to senior staff or phone calls to head office, or to their customer support or from complaint lines as outlined in their T's &  C's. Only now am I beginning to hear back once the charges began to drop off.I experienced FAILURE at all points in dealing with Expedia so recommend to all to BEWARE of using the Expedia site - unless you can cope with having your bank accounts and savings rendered useless for days on end.I will be contacting my bank shortly to recommend they complain to Visa as I am not sure that Expedia should be a trusted Visa merchant without more robust systems. I am also requesting details of the regulator who covers their activities as they may not be providing a full price comparison.Re Expedia response - No itinerary ref held as no flight booked. Try job ref S-110898080 and your complaints department who have full details in hard copy. Earmarking now removed at last."

The most ridiculous scam company
","I recently booked a ticket via Expedia travel services for a Saturday afternoon form  Johannesburg to Hong Kong (return) with South African Airways, to attend a business meeting the following Monday afternoon. I booked to leave on Saturday and returning on Monday night, as I work Monday to Friday in South Africa and needed to minimize my absence from work to minimize income/business loss. On the day of departure I arrived at the airport and was told the flight has been cancelled due to bad weather in HK. I inquired with the meteorological office in Hong Kong and they stated that there had been bad weather, but not to an extend that airlines couldn't approach, in fact - a competitor airline flew out on that same Saturday. The meteorological service also told me that the weather would have passed by the time of arrival of the flight  in Hong kong, so reasons to cancel the flight were subjective. However, I was given a cancellation confirmation by the airline to be taken back to the travel agent Expedia to organize a reschedule or refund. But when I called the travel agent, they told me that the airline refuses to refund and would only offer rescheduling within 7 days from time of original departure to time of new arrival (therefore with time difference real;ly only 6 days, not 7, which I would need to go out on Saturday and be able to return to Johannesburg on Monday with minimum business interruption.) As I booked and paid via Expedia - my agreement/contract is with them - but it did'nt bother them a bit that there would be no refund for my 6000HKD flight......and I could'nt even take up my fight with the airline directly, since the agreement is legally with Expedia, not South African, who had no interest to rectify the situation. The most ridiculous and unbelievable situation in my many years of air travel that I ever encountered - STAY AWAY FROM EXPEDIA TRAVEL AND STAY AWAY FORM SOUTH AFRICAN AIRWAYS.UPDATE: Thank you EXPEDIA for responding and for offering to look into this issue. My itinerary Number is: 121784179984 I also have the following news: 1) I doubled checked the South African Airways Terms and Conditions and they clearly state that FULL REFUNDS OR CLIENT SUITABLE REBOOKING ARE MANDATORY ACCORDING TO OFFICAL AIRLINE REGULATIONS. therefore it is clear that EXPEDIA STAFF is either ignorant (and arrogant) or just doesn't bother to check properly.  2) Furthermore - I called the airline directly on Sunday morning (the next day) to find out about the status of their flight schedule after the weather cancellation on Saturday. They told me that the Sunday flight was going to go out as scheduled but the plane already full (form the Sunday bookings + Platinum members + business class priority). However they IMMEDAIETLY OFFERED ME A FULL REFUND OR SUITABLE REBOOKING ANY TIME I CHOOSE  (as per their terms and conditions.)  THIS MEANS YOUR STAFF IS COMPLETELY UNPROFESSIONAL, MISINFORMED AND INCAPBALE TO DEAL WITH BUSINESS PARTNERS SUCH AS AIRLINES.In particular, you should immediately dismiss incapable customer service representatives such as Mr. Shiv and Mr. Videsh who were unprofessional and incompetent handling the issue when  I called them on Saturday.Nevertheless - since you offered to look into this incident - I look forward to your detailed response in regards to my itinerary.Thank you."

I called Expedia Customer Service and after an hour of to-ing and fro-ing I was informed by their representative, that his manager agreed they had, a) made a mistake and, b) failed to inform, and so they would refund for new tickets with another airline to get us back to Dammam next morning.  Again, I agreed charges for ticket change: 536 pounds was deducted immediately from my card. No flight information or E-tickets arrived, and still to date we are awaiting ticket and flight information. We had to pay the airline again to get home. Expedia have failed to respond to my request for action, and they also failed to respond to my solicitors request with a seven day time limit. The case has been registered in UK Courts for compensation claim againt Expedia UK."

Never using this appalling company again
",Booked to stay at the Horse and Groom through this company. What a mistake. I was asked to pay before they showed me to my room. I didn't realise Expedia had already taken money. The room was nothing like they show on the website. It was disgusting . So I asked for a refund and left. However when I checked my bank account. I discovered this mistake.I have made several phone calls to several different people with promises to help. Nothing.......I finally don't 30 minutes on the phone before being promised a refund. Then was given a lecture on Expedia procedure and told I shouldn't be getting a refund. Customer service is a complete joke. Itinerary number 19687916450

Customer Service
","It took a letter to the CEO USA after 3 months of trying to get satisfaction from Expedia UK.to get any help. I was told by Expedia USA that there is no customer service from the UK but everything is handled by Expedia India, I had been given untrue information regarding pre-selection of seats by somebody on the Expedia tUK telephone number ( which I now presume was Expedia INDIA).Was looked after by the USA office and offered compensation, which I was not asking for!"

Waste of space - no help at all.
","We used Expedia to book an internal return flight with Thai Smile from Bangkok to Phuket in February 2016. We have now had an email from Expedia telling us that Thai Smile have changed the flight  times and we have been given new flight times that are over an hour earlier. We will find it very difficult to make the flight.  We have contacted Expedia to ask if we can have a later flight time and they have told us they cannot do anything at all to help, we have no choice but to accept the change. We cannot change the times to suit our needs and Expedia will only refund a small amount of tax if we cancel. Given that the earlier flights were much cheaper when we booked originally,  we feel we have been well taken on this. I wrongly assumed booking with Expedia would offer some assistance with problems like this.  It is understandable if there are delays on the day, but not a change to flights several months in advance! I feel very annoyed and Expedia have been no help at all."

No email to confirm booking.
","I have used Expedia a number of times without problem.  However on booking a hotel for an upcoming trip to Bruges I did not receive the usual email to confirm my booking.  Their terms and conditions state ""Confirmation of a booking, which includes the essential elements such as the description of the Service(s) booked and the price, will be sent to the Customer by e-mail. If the Customer does not receive a confirmation e-mail within 24 hours of placing the booking, he / she should contact Customer Services"".  I therefore contacted customer services to see if the booking had gone through successfully and was told that nothing was booked under my email address.  I also checked with my account on Expedia and there were no ""upcoming"" trips stated.  To me this confirmed having to seek out another hotel and get something booked up with less than a week to go before my trip.  Unfortunately a couple of days later I then received a feedback email from expedia asking ""how do you rate us""  A quick call to expedia and it turns out that my hotel was booked after all and I am now in a position of having two hotels booked for the same trip.  I have made a complaint to expedia and they have advised it will take around 5 days to get back to me (1 day before my trip) with their response.  Itinerary number: 19764982312"

In league with B.A ??? UPDATE
","I book a flight and hotel package via Expedia,the flights with B.A. So when you book such a deal it kind of suggests you might be going on holiday and yes you are excited so perhaps don't check thoroughly. Then I find that luggage is not included -2 bags return = ?140 and then I check my seats and (very clever this one) we are booked into adjoining aisle seats. To change this to sit together = ?60 no matter where in the plane we wish to sit. Now the flights are costing an extra ?200.And its with B.A. an allegedly reputable company who have stooped to associate themselves with Expedia.Don't chose Expedia. I never will again and I hope this review costs them more than the ?200 they attempted to rob me of (they still got ?70--how can you go on holiday with no suitcases ?)And I don't want a stupid reply saying ""oh we are looking into this and will twatter you"" cos I'm not interested, spin Expedia, spin.Itinerary 19039067166.As an update I have had a prompt and efficient response from Expedia who have addressed the issue with baggage charges and sorted this to my satisfaction.

Dealing with Expedia is a very frustrating experience
","1. Hotel wasn't in the zone expedia say on the website. Therefore, transfer price doubled to ?90. Called the travel company in Turkey to clarify. Called expedia numerous times over two days, ""our systems are down"", call back later/we can't do anything. Cancelled the private transfer with the travel company direct.2. Email support is useless they reply ""we are unable to assist you with the refund queries via email"". Called them several times and wait on hold for over 15 minutes each time and give up. Called them again, repeated my issue over and over again to the same person. Their systems don't seem connect car hire, transfers, hotel bookings together so its a constant process of repeating itinerary numbers and the issue over and over again. Then they asked me to email to get the refund. Losing my patience rapidly I said i will not after emailing initially and then all the times i have tried to contact them. After 52 minutes on the phone i will apparently receive my refund within 7 days. After reading other reviews here I'm not so sure i will. The only way to get a refund or get some action quickly and without being on the phone all day or emailing them is to stand up to them, don't be pushed around and fobbed off. Say you want X and you want it now or want to speak to the manager.I spent nearly ?2800 with expedia for my holiday, i want good service and i want it quickly. I don't have time to repeatedly case them via email and phone. Of course this frustrating experience will affect my decision when i book my next holiday."

First rep stated extra ?50 on holiday
","I was booking on line and has the price of ?1012.72. Had a question so called. Rep said he could complete booking for me at same price but at the end apart from the one off fee, which I was expecting, there was a further almost ?50.  He said the plain fare must have changed and if I tried to finish the booking off, on line it wouldn't go through because of the change. Well he waited on the phone while I tried, but it offered the same with the ?16 one off fee.  So what was Rajid saying.  I told him he was wrong, and he said I must have just been lucky or the web site was not up to date.  I don't think that was true. And the person at Expedia reading this should investigate please."

Buyer beware!
","I booked a holiday on the weekend to fly out this Thursday.  The hotel was advertised as having 'full kitchen' so I decided to take along my elderly parents who don't like restaurant food. When I checked with the hotel they said there was no kitchen. I called Expedia who spoke to the hotel and they told me room has microwave, kettle and fridge.........this is not a full kitchen but I can make some compromises and make it work. I went back to the hotel myself to check and they said since I booked a room I don't get that either. Again I called Expedia and they said they need to log it and investigate and someone will call me back in 48 hours. It's now Monday, I'm meant to fly out on Thursday and I am none the wiser as to what is happening. I've called Expedia again and they tell me they have escalated the issue but I can cancel my holiday if I want. No, I do not want to cancel, I have arranged to meet other members of my family at this hotel, they are flying in from a different location. Shocking false advertising and misrepresentation or just plain incompetence. I may have to cancel taking my parents along. A holiday is meant to be relaxing, instead I'm stressed........thanks Expedia. I won't be booking with yourselves ever again.So, Expedia admit it's their mistake but won't fix it because it will cost them money.  All they can do is offer me a cancellation........on hotel only. If I can't take my parents what good are the flights to me??(I have thankfully been able to cancel my flights also, although they did try to con me out of ?20 on each booking. When I called them up to query this they said it was the booking admin fee, which under the circumstances they would refund........I should think so too)19765408363 - incidentally, your false advrtisement is still on your website misleading other consumers"

Our  baby died. Travel date changed. No flight at airport. No apology.No response. Defrauded air ticket.
","My experience has been horrific! Expedia is going down as another Enron or Madoff where they take your money and then disappear with no resolution to complaints. In March my wife and I had a 1 night break booked for March. Our baby was miscarried sadly so I rescheduled the trip to August 8th 2015. A truly traumatic time and this also cost over ?250 to do. The day before flying in August I checked the Itinerary and everything was confirmed. On arrival at Gatwick on 8th August British Airways had a flight for my wife but no record of me at the check in desk despite me showing them the iItinerary and ticket number. BA explained this error happens frequently with Expedia and said I had to buy a ticket if I wanted to fly. I desperately called Expedia and the customer service said it would take too long to investigate but logged my complaint. So I had to pay ?527 for a ticket to Venice. The trip was badly tainted by the worry about what had happened. I called Expedia repeatedly on my return. The same India call centre said they would escalate but then I heard nothing. I emailed the bfscrd customer relations complaints department with my scanned in air tickets that I had to pay with BA and the Itineraryschedule. The only acknowledgement from Expedia was a auto responder saying they are experiencing high volumes of emails:""We are currently experiencing an unexpected increase in e-mail requests, preventing us from responding within our normal standards. Be assured that we are working diligently to handle all requests in a timely manner and in the order received."" This has been going on for 50 days now. No one is looking into this for me. IT IS A SCAM!!! Expedia have taken my money for a flight they never provided. I have paid over ?1200 for a 1 night stay in Venice. I had to fund the BA flight on my credit card and Expedia owe me the refund but have not even apologised. I find this absolutely disgusting and appalling given we had to pay over ?250 to change the flights because our baby died. And then they screw up by not booking me a ticket. They have committed fraud and need to refund my costs immediately as I have not received the service I paid for. I have searched in vain for someone in Expedia to look into my case but it just goes back to CRD team in India.This is an appalling company and something needs to be done about Expedia.Itinerary# 17981018911 CRD Ref: -5527655 Baby died and you do nothing! - Case ID : [REQ:M-11487647] Please could someone help me to bring this appalling company to justice?"

BA checked baggage not included despite Expedia saying it was
","We booked to fly out with BA tomorrow, specifically choosing Expedia, as their website stated that this was a ticket that included checked baggage.  I am well aware that many airlines (including BA) now charge to check baggage, and Expedia's website does point to airlines for this in most cases, but in this case, it explicitly stated that 1 bag per traveller was included in the price.When the confirmation from BA came through, 7 days before the flight, however, it stated that it was hand baggage only, and that checking bags would cost ?20 per person per flight, totalling ?80.  In addition, whereas flights including checked baggage could change seats for free (we wanted to select the emergency exit row), our flights would cost ?7, another ?28 in total.  In all, an additional ?108 for services that Expedia's website claimed were included.Having contacted Expedia, the best they were prepared to offer was a refund of 50% of the baggage fees, which will mean we will be ?68 out of pocket.To add insult to injury, they claimed they only keep details of the bookings to 30 days (co-incidentally expiring the day we first contacted them!) so they could not check to see whether we should have baggage allowance included or not.Be warned!  If your Expedia page claims you should have baggage included, take a screenshot while you can, and check with the airline as soon as you can!UPDATE: Although Expedia have responded to say that they are happy to have resolved the issue, it should be noted that they only resolved it after about 10 e-mails and phone calls, and after I hunted through their own website to find screenshots where they were STILL offering the flight we were on with ""checked baggage included"", and the page where it stated that the first bag was free.  Until I found these and sent the screenshots, they were still only offering to pay 50% of the baggage fees.It took a formal complaint e-mail with screenshots of their own website to force them to capitulate."

Shocking service
","I mistakenly booked a flight on Aeromexico through Expedia.co.uk, late one evening. I phoned to cancel it the next day, within 24 hours of booking. The Expedia consultant said that although it was within 24 hours and I should be refunded, I could not as the airline had already issued the ticket. He advised I contact the airline directly in order to cancel the flight, and give me a UK number, but the offices were closed. I sent an email to both Expedia and Aeromexico. The airline responded quickly saying had I booked the flight through them directly I would have been refunded in full, however because I booked through Expedia this was not possible.THREE MONTHS later Expedia have still not bothered to respond, despite a deeply dissatisfied feedback sent in addition. A further phone call had the consultant telling me I had to cancel the flight on the same day of issuing i.e. within 2 hours, and that I had not emailed Expedia. I had to supply the reference number of the responding email, in order to prove my case.

Trip to NYC complaint ignored by Expedia...
","I sent the email below to Expedia last week and was told I would get a response within 48 hours?. I have heard nothing!!I have just returned from a 4 night trip in New York City. I booked this trip through Expedia on 25 July 2015. I spent many weeks researching hotels and areas that I would like to visit. I finally decided on the WestHouse New York hotel. My package (hotel and flights) cost a total of ?1636.88. This amount was takes from my account almost straight away, which according to my booking confirmation meant that my trip was confirmed ""prices and hotel availability are not guaranteed until full payment is received"". So when the money left my account, my trip, in my opinion, was confirmed. However, on the 3rd of September at 10.13pm UK time, less than 10 hours before my flight to New York, I received an email telling me my hotel reservation couldn't be confirmed. The email instructed me to call Expedia and I was given an American number to contact. I called this number 3 times but kept being cut off after I gave my details. I then tried on numerous occasions to contact WestHouse hotel. I was put on hold for long periods at a time while people tried to look into my situation. Eventually they told me I needed to call Expedia. I tried Expedia again and spoke with a member of your team. It was now approximately 1am UK time (8 hours before I was due to fly to New York) and I was told that due to unforeseen circumstances my hotel had to be changed. I asked why I was being told this information just hours before I was due to travel but I was not given an answer to this question. I was told that my hotel would be changed to the Sofitel and I was put on hold for 20 minutes. When the call was recommenced, I advised the person on the phone that this hotel was not in the area I wanted to stay in. I picked WestHouse hotel for many reason, one being its location. I was informed that Sofitel was only 12 blocks away. I said this was not acceptable and I was told that it was the only one they were going to offer me as New York was very busy. I expressed my upset and disbelief at being informed of these changes just hours before I was due to leave my home. I asked for information about cancelling my whole trip and being refunded the ?1636 because these changes being made at this point was not acceptable. I was informed that this was not possible as she had made the new reservation. I told her that there had clearly been some sort of miss communication because I had not instructed her to go ahead and make the reservation. At this point, to my disbelief, the person I was talking to hang up on me. I am extremely angry and upset about how this whole situation has been handled. I was on the phone from the UK to the United States for almost 3 hours. I have no idea what these calls will have cost me but I should not have to pay to make calls about changes that were out with my control. Everything from dinner reservations to airport transfers were affected due to this last minute change to my trip. More importantly,  the anxiety and upset at having to deal with this during then night only hours before we were due to travel is just not acceptable and I wish to be compensated. I look forward to hearing from you.Itinerary number as requested: 19289032658"

","I first complained 11 days ago, I have heard nothing since. I am getting upset just writing this message. I was in Florence nearly two weeks ago, when I booked a wine tasting trip for me and my partner. I called up the wine tasting provider, Tuscan trails, and they said they had no record of my sale and that expedia keep selling spaces on a trip that is fully booked. Once hearing this, we booked another one but then found out expedia have taken 200 pounds out of my account. I am now in my overdraft, in trouble wi the bank and expedia are doing nothing about it. I call and wait 2 hours to be spoken to, they just say they will ring me back within two days. I then wait two days, then hear nothing back, so I then call and they just say the same.

Expedia.co.uk - not only dishonest but arrogant, too
","I have booked several flights and hotels on Expedia.co.uk - until now.A few days ago I happened to book an easyJet ticket on the website. I accepted the cost assuming that it was the same amount that I would have paid on the easyJet site. The surprise came when I got an e-mail confirmation from easyJet stating ?23 less than what I actually paid. So I checked easyJet website and I saw that indeed there was ?23 difference between their price and Expedia""s. I was upset. Not because of the amount but because I was decades long, loyal customer to Expedia and I was cheated.I called them and asked about the extra charge. I got some textbook answer that Expedia is not charging me, it is only the airline who does. I said it was not the case but got nowhere. Then I said I want to use my right of 24 hour free cancellation. I was answered I can only cancel with the airline directly since Expedia does not even see my reservation. I asked what I paid the ?23 fee for, then? The agent only repeated that Expedia does not charge but the airline does.Then I called my bank and verified that Expedia indeed charged additional GBP 23, so I wrote to customer service complaining about the higher price than the one advertised by easyJet and asked whether the 24 hour free cancellation or the best price guarantee applied. I have not got an answer to either of these questions but I received a confirmation that Expedia - despite the previous statement - did charge ?23 additional fee and I was reminded that when I booked the ticket I gave consent to this.Then I answered saying that as a loyal customer I was disappointed about it and repeated my question how I can exercise the best price guarantee? The only answer I got that the booking fee was not refundable, without any response to the best price guarantee inquiry. This was the point when I gave up - for ever.Itinerary #19669123962"

Terrible Customer Service
","Itinerary Number: 18259677920I recently returned to the UK from a holiday in America, where I hired a vehicle using your Expedia service. The vehicle hire at the LAX destination went smoothly. However, two days in to the car rental period of a 12 day rental the oil warning light on the computer was displayed and advised that an oil change was required. This especially was necessary as I was travelling over 400 miles in the coming days during my holiday. In total I travelled nearly 1,000 miles and should the oil change not have been completed this would have caused significant engine issues. Prior to undertaking the oil change in the vehicle, I contacted the Dollar customer service team who provided two options to remedy the oil change issue. The first was to get the oil changed myself at a local mechanic and retain the receipt for reimbursement at the drop off location when I return the vehicle and the second was to return the vehicle to the nearest Dollar car rental centre which was over 1 hour away. Due to ease and convenience I choose the former option of replacing the oil with a mechanic. The oil change took over half a day to complete including travelling to the mechanic.  When it came to return the vehicle, I spoke to the manager at the Las Vegas branch (Gina Ferraro) and explained the situation and provided the receipt, she reassured me that the money for the oil change would be refunded and that as an offer of goodwill a day?s rental fee would be returned to me for the inconvenience caused. She took all my details including a copy of the oil change receipt and rental information. Upon returning to the UK it has been over 5 weeks later, no correspondence or refund has been received to date from your organisation. This was very disappointing to be responsible for undertaking maintenance to a rental vehicle while I was on holiday celebrating my honeymoon. A holiday is a time for relaxation and you should not be required to complete mundane chores or vehicle maintenance as you would at home, this should be an opportunity to step away from it all. A rental vehicle should not require an oil change to be undertaken by the customer and this should form part of the standard checks carried out by the Dollar staff upon receiving vehicles back. Many modern cars have computer systems on board which permits users to identify key maintenance features including when an oil change is required. After not hearing from either Dollar or Expedia, I decided to make contact via phone with Expedia and waited for over 55 minutes on 24.08.2015 for a customer service advisor to confirm that she will email the contacts I provided over the phone of the Dollar General Manager and Las Vegas Dollar Manager. It was upsetting to learn that I was on hold for a considerable amount of time to only discover that an email would be sent using the information that I had provided and no further to receiving a resolution. The email that I was copied in to was horrendously written and did not convey the purpose of my call or aggravation concisely. I believe this is not appropriate that you permit external emails to be sent out to customers that have been poorly constructed.Numerous phone calls later, to date I have spent over 8 hours on the telephone with the Expedia customer service team either in conversation or a large amount of time on hold. I have been reassured of two phone calls to provide an update and no communication has been received. This has become increasingly frustrating and my customer complaint must be investigated immediately for my refund to be issued. There are many notes associated to my itinerary number (18259677920) and recently attempted to resolve this issue and yet again was unsuccessful, the notes reference number for this is S-108366932. I have also sent several emails with no correspondence or acknowledgement of any kind and find this a disgraceful manner to treat paying and loyal customers. It is not acceptable that I am required to contact Expedia / Dollar for the oil change refund and the goodwill gesture offered of one full rental day refunded. A large organisation as yours that processes numerous customers holiday arrangements on a daily basis policies and procedures should be in place to ensure situations as the one described above do not occur. I have spent thousands of pounds via the Expedia website on hotels, flights, rentals cars and to have experienced a substandard customer service level is not satisfactory, it has tainted my experience of the service. I will be informing friends and family of this exceptionally poor customer service and advise all relatives never to use Expedia again."

False/misleading advertising
",On Saturday I booked a hotel in Manchester for the last weekend in November. I wanted a one night stay with breakfast for 3 people. I found an offer which one your website states breakfast included and booked and paid in full. On receiving the itinerary information following booking I noticed that the breakfast was only included for 2 people. Now tell me why I would book a room for 3 people and only feed 2?! I called to check the details and the girl checked with the hotel and confirmed that it was only included for 2. Now if this is what the hotel is offering your advertisement for that particular hotel should state this. If this had been advertised I would have chosen a different hotel. Your advertising is false/misleading! I am still awaiting my return phone call from Saturday as I asked. To be escalated. And I still have heard nothing!! I have photographic evidence of what your website was offering prior to booking as I sent a picture to my sister before booking the hotel to check she was happy with it. Disgruntled and disappointed customer. You should not be advertising something that you are in fact NOT selling!!! Get this sorted!!!! My itinerary is 19618484345.I have since spoken to Mani from customer services who has been a great help and solved the issue for myself. I hope the mobile site is now adjusted to show that only 2 breakfasts included per room so that other customers due not end up in the same situation. Thank you many for speedy solving of the problem.

Worst company I have ever had the misfortune to book anything with. 1 star is too good even.
","Expedia.co.uk have ruined my 2015 holiday plans in complete an utter entirity. Not only have Expedia broken the contract I entered into with them back in Feb 2015 when I booked Paris flight, hotel with B&B & ground transport, but they have broken several promises via 4 phone calls and 17 emails to 5 different email addresses. Every phone call I have made has been to incompetent people in Bangalore who couldn't care less about they're customers. One girl didn't even know which department she worked for and even had the cheek to tell me I cancelled my flights when it was 'cityjet' that pulled out of flying from Cardiff! There is never a floor manager available. They have ignored and deleted posts on Twitter and FB as well as a formal letter of complaint to their legal department. And just to add insult to injury, I am still owed the ?847.54 I feel has been stolen from me. I shan't go into the distressed daughter who had no holiday, countless hours of time I have spent trying to get some response from this company and undue, unwanted stress it has caused. I am still trying to get a proper UK address for this company which no-one will give me (probably because there isn't one). Stay well away from this fraudulent company."

Hotel Refund, promises, promises
","it became necessary for me to cancel a three night stay in Italy with Expedia due to the untimely death of my father. I explained the situation to the customer service agent who contacted the hotel and agreed the refund and forward me an email to confirm the funds would be credited in 5-15 working days. That was 3rd July. I have since emailed Expedia and received no reply. I have called Expedia 5 times, each time receiving an apology and re assurance that the money will be credited, still nothing! Last Thursday 3 September, I was informed that there had been a ""technical issue"" with crediting to my bank, and they would try again to credit the money and someone from refunds would call me back if there was any further problem either that day or the following day.

By far the most inneficient customer service.
","Just after posting this review, an agent from the social media called me and proceeded the refund, which is nice. Hope it will work this time, and thank you. Here is the original complaint :I booked a car (itinerary number 7125546055908) and had to cancel because the legislation had recently changed and the driver needed additional documentation.  I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR THE REFUND SINCE THE 25TH OF JULY !Naturally Expedia?s website didn?t mention the new legislation. I cancelled the booking over the phone with an agent, who took my full bank details, name and information, gave me an ?internal reference for the refund? and assured me that the funds would be back on my account within 7 working days. Since I have sent 5 emails to the customer service, getting two replies assuring me they forwarded the issue to the concerned department and that they will get back to me at the earliest.I have also called around 15 times, was put on hold for over three hours. I was very disappointed to notice that it was taking so long to contact the refunds department, when someone would answer the call within seconds at the sales department. Someone said they had no record of the refund being approved before cutting the conversation short.She actually was the only person I spoke to who wasn't nice, I must say that the rest of the people (about four) were quite nice. Inefficient though.Last week I called at 1am, which seems to be a better time to call, got through to an agent, who said his management team will contact me within the next 24 hours. Nothing since.It might only be ?87, but I will not give up on this ! This is by far the worst customer service I have ever witnessed. Other companies understand that the customers will return if they after-sales issues are dealt with correctly. Well, I WILL NEVER USE EXPEDIA AGAIN."

Expedia lies about hotel facilities on their website and ignores request for refund
","We booked a hotel through Expedia for a weekend away and booked somewhere expensive with a poolside bar and (obviously) double beds because we wanted to relax and not worry about hotel quality whilst on holiday. When we went to bed the first night we realised that the bed was simply two beds pushed together, which means that they fall apart every time you roll over. Upon complaining the next day the hotel manager said that they didn't have double beds at all. When we went to look for the poolside bar, we were told that there was no bar available by the pool. We complained to Expedia because we would never had stayed at that hotel if they hadn't lied about what was available. Expedia obviously agreed because they asked the hotel for a refund, but the hotel refused to give it to us. Expedia then patronisingly offered us a voucher for Expedia which covers less than 15% of the cost of the hotel.Even though Expedia's terms and conditions state that they are responsible for the ""accuracy of description of travel offerings displayed on the Website"", this is obviously a lie. Do not trust what Expedia says about hotels. They lie, ruin your holiday and do nothing about it. Disgusting.The itinerary number is 19246108710. UPDATE: After providing an itinerary number I got a call from M and all he could do was, well, nothing except give me cash instead of a voucher (15% of total cost of my hotel as a ""gesture of goodwill"", which is more like a slap in the face). Apparently there are no managers to talk to and no other ways of complaining. And no, Expedia have still not deleted the false information about the hotel on their website, so they still lying to their customers. I have forwarded my complaint to the Trading Standards Association in the UK because, according to the Citizen's Advice Bureau, ""any attempt to mislead a consumer could be considered a criminal offence under the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008"". I am fed up with big corporations treating customers like rubbish, and am frankly surprised that Expedia even survives as a company, since many other big corporations selling hotel rooms and flights manage to have a lot more satisfied customers than Expedia do. I guess you could say that Expedia is the Ryanair of hotel bookings. Use at your own risk!"

I have contacted them twice and after finally getting through to someone and quoting reference, they have put me on hold without saying anything and left me holding on for 20 minutes until I gave up! I tried once more and they said I had come through to the wrong department and will transfer me - another hold of 20 minutes, where I eventually gave up.

","By far the worst company I've had the misfortune to use.I have booked a holiday later in September to go to Vegas with Expedia I booked back in February. In June whilst working away I had an email saying I needed to call them. When I got back I did and they said they had a request from the airline  to alter my flights. The times didn't suit as the return flight time is far earlier and I'd still be on my way back from an excursion.In July I wanted to check the seats I had as I have friends who booked through the airline directly and wanted to sit with them. Anyway the booking itinerary had the changed flight times, the ones I hadn't approved. I called Expedia over and over each time being told someone would call me back. I even called American Airlines and they told me Expedia asked for the change as the new flight times were cheaper although I'd neither approved the change or had a refund for the new flights.I have called Expedia at least a dozen times and now they are saying during the call in June I'd approved the flight changes which is a complete lie!Going nowhere with this company and I still have no idea how I'm going to get home unless I cancel my excursion which had already cost me over a thousand dollars.

I was all happy and excited for about a day when all of a sudden I got notified by my bank that I was over ?1000 overdrawn. Bank then say it's BA holding the money. Call Expedia, they blames BA. I then called BA and they blamed Expedia!Very very angry! Why on earth are BA holding money from my account when I've already paid Expedia?! Im guessing Expedia juat share bank details to them?! Absolutely appalling. When booking there was no warning that funds being held at all.My bank have said the money should be released soon but if it wasn't for my banks information I'd be none the wiser! Still to this day have no justifiable explanation for money being held on my account when I had already paid Expedia! In a completely awful situation now as the money that is being held off my account is to pay bills. This is peoples lives this terrible service is affecting!"

very bad customer service I will not use Expedia Again
",Expedia have no understanding of customer satisfaction and do not return calls. Just constantly put you on hold.  I have called 3 times at different time each time I have beennon hold in excess of 40 minutes. The customer service desk in India may be polite but they do not undertand service or try to understand the issue. Expedia have global customers yet there only seems to be one manager on each shift to deal with complaints or escalations totally unacceptable. I will not be using expedia again. My issue still is not resolved which is to change names on excursions expedia customer service is to put the customer on hold. I have waited 5 days since logging my service ticket and told someone will call me back within 48 hours still no one has. The managers name is Deepak Guwalani who still has not spoken to me its now 1 hour being on hold. Deepak you need to look up the term customer service clearly you have no idea how to manage a service desk.

6% refund
","We booked a return flight to Puerto Rico from Gatwick via Madrid. Total cost ?2,898.56 including taxes. We cancelled the flight a month prior to departure due to a change in circumstances. On cancelling the flight we where advised that we would get around ?300 per person back. A month after the light was due to return, I rang Expedia to be told we would get a refund of ?57.14 per person within 3 months of the date of travel. After over an hour on the phone we have a refund of around ?100 per person. The actual cost of the flight was ?459, taxes total was ?307. Even if the flight was non refundable, the taxes should be. Expedia have pocketed ?800 (No tax would have been paid as we did not travel, Air Europa who we where due to fly with had ?1,836 which I knew was non refundable even though they might have sold the tickets. BAD PRACTICE. What out if you need to change your plans. Air Europa would not give a credit note for the actual flight either.

Seats on flight not confirmed with airline. Family seated all over plane.
","Thank god for United airlines.Upon checking in 24 hours prior to our outbound flight online, I noticed we weren't seated together, despite selecting seats when I booked. I called Expedia, who couldn't help, they just said that the seats hadn't been confirmed with the airline. They then advised ME to contact the airline (why use a travel agent?). United were shocked the travel agent had allocated seats for a family with young children and not seated them together. They remedied this right away.While on holiday, I called Expedia to check they hadn't done the same with our return flight. They had. Again, they expected ME to contact United to resolve it, and again, United were horrified at what Expedia had done and resolved it right away.United's theory was that, when booking, the Expedia website had allowed me to select seats that were either unavailable or more expensive, and rather than notify me, allocated the four cheapest seats on the flight, regardless of whether they were together.I expected using Expedia, rather than booking the flight and hotel myself to be easier, but it actually added complications."

Misrepresentation and terrible customer service
","I booked a holiday with Expedia to Sardinia. When we got there our room bore no resemblance to the one in the pictures on the website. Far from being a 4* room with views of the harbour we got a 2* room with a view of a street. The fridge didn't work, the TV was from the 1990's, the bathroom was badly built and the room was dark and pokey. The hotel didn't have any of the good rooms left. I rang Expedia and got repeatedly put on hold, cut off and told I would be called back. They told me they would get a refund from the hotel - this was a lie as it turned out they hadn't paid the hotel at that point. They told me someone from their complaints department would call me back in 4 hours. That was 10 days ago. I've tried emailing. The website says they take complaints seriously and will respond in 48 hours. It's now 5 days since I emailed. I've heard nothing from them despite repeated emails. There's no point in calling them as you just get the Indian call centre who put you on hold and tell you someone will call you back. Terrible customer service to compound misrepresenting the accommodation.Just as an update to this. I've tried repeatedly to complain to Expedia. Eventually I got hold of someone through facebook who said they would investigate my complaint within 28days but now they're saying that they don't have my complaint even though they acknowledged receipt of it once!

Awful Customer Service
","I booked flights to America in July 2015, to go and visit my parents for a week. I booked through Expedia, as I have usually had a good experience of finding good deals through them and the process of booking is fairly simple. However, having received all of the standard confirmation emails and even being able to print my boarding pass for Atlanta online the day before, on arrival to the gate at Heathrow, I was told that my entire trip (all four flights) had been voided by Expedia for no reason whatsoever. I was fuming at this point, as the money for the flights had left my account (of which I had proof with an online statement), and Expedia never ONCE contacted me to inform me of this cancellation. Nor did I contact them to cancel or amend my flights. I was made to contact my mother in America (at 3am her time) to ask her to contact Expedia to reinstate the booking. She was made to wait 25 minutes on hold, whilst an extremely rude lady provided no help whatsoever. The ladies at the gate then contacted Expedia, and it took 30 minutes in total to resolve what should have been an easy problem to fix! I was told at the gate that I would have to pay an additional ?1,186.00 on top of the amount I had already paid for my flights, which was absolutely absurd. Fortunately, I was able to board my flight very last minute, but I subsequently had problems with every flight during my trip. I emailed Expedia from America, and it has taken them nearly a month to respond to my complaint. Having just heard back today, I have now been told that I will need to wait a further 28 working days for a response.I have worked in the travel industry, and never in my life have I come across such terrible customer service. From one of the largest providers of travel in the world, Expedia should really be doing better. a 28 working day response period is ridiculous and just shows that they are clearly inundated with complaints. It's safe to say that unless I am compensated for this inconvenience, I will definitely not be using Expedia again and I will be spreading the word until their service is sorted out."

Every effort will be made to minimise noise and disturbance.So I looked at Expedia's reviews and a review posted on 1 July 2015 said that the hotel would be closing on Sunday for good.  Apparently it is getting renovated and will be a Holiday Inn.So I went on trip advisers web site and found a response from the General Manager, Chimo Hotel saying that the Hotel was closed.  The Receptionist at our hotel in Quebec rang the Chimo Hotel and an answer phone message confirmed the closure.We then at 10 at night, had to find another hotel to stay in Ottawa for the following night.

","I used to be  a satisfied expedia customer. But lately Expedia has gone from bad to worse ever since their call center has moved to India.  I have booked my package through their website. As far as I know there is only one airport in Dubai only to find out on the 1st of August that there are two in Dubai. The website and confirmation email both don't state any information in regard to this new airport. After reading on line, experiencing it myself and meeting a couple in the new airport who arrived few minutes after I have made it and paid a taxi driver 150 DH back and forth I found out that I am not the only victim of this situation.In order not to lose out on my package I had to book a totally new tickets with Emirate Airline which cost me quite a lot of money. I called expedia from Dubai airport on the same night and the customer service man was totally supportive and assured me that he will raise a complaint and ask Qatar airways to refund me the money. I received an email to confirm that my complaint has been logged and I will get a reply within 72 hours. I got back from my trip today and I checked my email and I had not received an email from expedia. I contacted expedia and after being on hold for almost 1 hour and I was told sorry but the customer service team cant take this matter further and I will not receive a refund.  I asked for a phone number for Qatar airways but I was given an invalid phone number.I didn't give up I called the Qatar airline customer service in Doha after finding their number on line as the number I got from expedia was invalid. Qatar airline assured me that my ticket is totally refundable and that I only have to pay around ?50 for each ticket but they will refund the rest. Each ticket was around ?508. Once again I am disappointed with Expedia customer service and I am a requesting a refund for my tickets. I called them many times and was on hold over and over and all they do is waste time and act silly to delay the process. I still have not received a refund.

We ended up staying in a twin room rather than a double as it was the only room they had free.The customer service from Expedia since has been nothing short of awful. I emailed them my complaint, heard nothing for weeks only to eventually be told that they had contacted the hotel and that they had no record of us ever staying there. The genius customer service advisor had somehow managed to contact a hotel of the same name in a completely different country, depsite me telling them where it was and giving them the booking number.Another couple of weeks down line after much more chasing on our part they have now offered no apology or refund, and have instead offered us a ?25 voucher so that we can waste more money on them.The whole experience has been incredibly disappointing, very rude and very helpful."

On contacting Expedia I was informed that the hire company  would collect me from the airport and take me to pick up the car and that I would also have to pay an extra 40 euro fee which wasn't mentioned at the time of booking.  I wasn't happy but begrudgingly agreed to this.  The car hire place was off the airport and we were advised to contact the hire company for further details which I did.  I was advised to go to a particular pick up point where a driver would be waiting or to call their number if we had any problems.  On arrival, there was nobody there to meet us and no reply from the car hire company on calling.  We promptly contacted expedia who put me on hold for a long time , when they eventually came back, they advised me to take a taxi to my destination and keep the receipts, which i would be refunded for.  They also said that I would receive a cal within 24-48 hours to provide a refund.I returned from holiday 8 days later, with still no contact from expedia.  When I called them to get a refund for the car hire and my taxi refund, I was told some one would contact me within 48 hours. I said that this was unacceptable and i needed it sorted now.

I can never use Expedia again after my experience on 1/8/2015
","On the evening of Saturday 1st August I attempted to book a trip to Pisa for 3 of us on-line, as a birthday present for my sister.  I got as far as the payment stage, only to be informed (via a message on the screen) that my debit card would not go through, so the trip was not booked and, consequently, I had no itinerary number.  Knowing that there was nothing wrong with my debit card, I started the process again, this time selecting a different hotel.  I tried several different hotels but each time the payment would not go through; clearly, there was a problem with the Expedia website!  On Sunday morning I tried again and encountered the same problem.  At this point, I phoned Expedia to book and, once again,  my payment would not go through.  I then phoned my bank, only to discover, to my horror, that there were 7 transactions for ?234.26 from Expedia (or their agent!) pending on my account, as well as 2 zero ones (as these could not go through, as they had virtually emptied my account!) and the holiday I was trying to book only cost circa ?600!  My bank told me that Expedia would need to send them a fax immediately, stating that they would not be taking this money, to enable them to free up my bank account so that I can use it.  I have spoken to Expedia twice since; each occasion was a long and difficult procedure and I was cut off several times.  Each time, I explained that they needed to send the fax immediately, as I have no other money or credit cards and only ?20 in cash so I have no means of purchasing anything until my bank releases my money back to me.  I phoned my bank's UK Call Centre earlier, and they have not received the fax yet, 4 days later!  I am appalled that this could happen in the first place, and totally disgusted by Expedia's attitude.  I suspect that they will not send the fax at all, and I will have to wait another 6 days for by bank to remove the pending transactions (apparently, they do this automatically after 10 days).  How can I survive for another 6 days without any money.? I am still hoping to take my sister to Pisa for her birthday, but I cannot book the trip until I can use by bank account again.  Although the customer services representatives at Expedia could see all the bogus transactions in their records, I don't think they could comprehend why I needed them to get them removed immediately.  Perhaps if their call centre had been in the UK things would have been different.  I feel that they should be offering me compensation - perhaps a free trip from Dublin to Pisa."

Finally called on 24th July and was promised someone would call me on Saturday - which they did. Now, this chap maintained that it would take up to 12 weeks to retrieve my flight refund, as they had to get it back from the Airline, (they also seem to think I flew with Budget Airlines not FlyBe!).Now, money can be taken from my debit card instantly by FlyBe, and I have known refunds take no more than 3 days from supermarkets. How can it take 12 weeks to receive a refund from Expedia? Expedia are the vendor, they made a mistake, I expect my refund instantly. If it takes the full twelve weeks, which I fully expect it will, that will mean they will have had my money for nearly eight months. This is bordering on theft.The chap I spoke to on the phone, while perfectly polite would not budge on the 12 weeks. How can this be allowed?"

Terrible and cause overbookings
",I am a hotelier that allows Expedia to book rooms with us and you charge the highest commission rate than any other channel managers. Yet why do you over book when we don't have availability sometimes. I'm not talking of moving someone to a different room I'm talking about not have a room for the dates requested not only does it cause stress to the hotelier but also for the guest also. This needs to be resolved as its a common problem for all hoteliers who work with Expedia especially in the peak seasons. Partner  service is also shocking for us as it appears to be for customer service. It seems your not well at taking the responsibility. Would much rather have a better working relationship as shouldn't be wanting to both please our mutual guests and get it right

BE WARNED !!!!!!!!!!!!    Incorrect information on web site for BA flights.
","I booked flights last week for my family on BA flights for the end of August.Before I booked the flights I checked the baggage allowance and it confirmed the following carry-on bag  No Fee.1st checked bag No Fee.Today I went into BA my bookings on their website and have found out that there was no baggage allowance on my flight,  I rang BA to see if there was a mistake only to be told that it was only a carry on fare! I then rang Expedia customer services, to be greeted  by one of there customer service team who was more intrested in talking over me. I was told that I could pay for the baggage and IF it was found to be a mistake on there website they would give me my money back ? I told the operative that this was not acceptable why should I have to pay for something that the website told me there was no charge, oh I wish that I had booked directly with BA. Expedia are misleading customers be warned as there site confirms that there is No fee and when you go through the booking and even click on the baggage allowance it still States the same.  I have sent over a screen print saying that there are no fees and have been told that I have to wait 72 business hours for someone to come back to me. I can not understand this as they were checking my booking when I was on the phone to them for over 40 minutes slowly loosing the will to live.I am not the first but I hope that I am the last to be missold and misinformed by Expedia.They should let their customers know what they are getting or a transparent cost.I will wait and see what response I get from them.Thank you Expedia for making my first dealings with your company so stressful ."

Very polite but not interest in solving problems
","17th July-I booked a Premium Economy multi trip flights from Expedia on the internet, it went through perfectly. Received email confirming my bookings with link to itinerary.18th July -I found that I needed to change the last leg of the flight by one day for a very important reason.I immediately contacted the help desk and agreed to paying the fee for the airline to make the change. It was handled smoothly.  At this point I was very impressed with the service.19th On checking my email saw and email from Expedia informing me that there was ?a problem with my card? and to phone Expedia.I called and established that my bank had refused the put the fee charge through, I  called my bank, and the charge for the flights had been processed, only the fee was refused because it exceeded my credit limit. It sorted it out immediately and the bank told me that there will be no more problems.  I called back, got another person, and asked him to put the charge through for the fees, he went away for a while and the batteries on my phone died.  I changed the batteries called back again and spoke to a third person and told him that the bank will accept the charge if he put it through again.  I told him that only the EWR - LHR flight need to be put back from 18th to 17th.  He started telling me the details of the flight mentioning  ?y economy? seats I reminded him that I it was a ?premium economy seat?.  I gave him the credit card number and then he said he will get his team to sort it out and will send me an email within 48 hours.  I was still happy with the operators and even agreed to give them a glowing feed-back.21st July -I have not received any communication from Expedia, so I checked my itinerary, to my horror and disbelief; he had changed all the 3 legs of the flight to economy instead of premium economy and left the charge at the premium economy rate.   I telephoned to let them know about the error and after putting me on hold several times, they admitted that it was their error and wanted another 48 hours to rectify it. When I pointed out that the premium economy seats may not be available if there are any delays, he asked me to pay upfront to ""upgrade"" it and then they will refund the original amount.  I had lost faith in them by that time and asked to speak to the supervisor.I then spoke to the supervisor, she admitted that Expedia made the error and apologised but could not do anything other than for me to pay first then get the refund otherwise it?ll take from 24 to 48 hours.  I asked her to call me back within 24 hours to inform me of the progress.22nd July - Having had no phone calls from Expedia after 24 hours, I phoned up at about 12 noon and asked to speak to the above supervisor, I was put on hold again twice, then was informed that they will send her an email to phone me in 4 hours.   Expedia again failed to keep their promise.23 July ? the 48 hours expired and no communication from Expedia so I phoned again, the operative put me on hold, came back, asked me about the problem, I told her that I had paid for premium economy and were given economy seats and that Expedia missed their 48 hour deadline and no one had contacted me, put on hold again so she could check with the Escalations team, came back and said the premium economy seats on the 1st leg of the flight are sold out and promised me that someone will call me back within 4 hours.  No phone call from Expedia.Expedia call centre operatives are always polite and patient, I can rate them as excellent on that point, but they always put you on hold several times on each call and promise to call you back, they never call back almost as if they are trying to put as much obstacle for their customers as possible instead of helping them.I read the reviews and am interested in whether Stuart Newman resolved all the problems promptly and to the customers? satisfaction.JohnJust heard back from the Priority Team saying that they have sorted my flights out, and sent me a new itinerary.  On reading it I noticed that the charge is higher than my original booking, so phoned my bank and were told that the full amount of over ?4000 had been taken out of my bank yesterday this was on top of what I paid originally, I knew nothing about it. Expedia did not consult me before putting this charge through and obviously waited until it was approved before contacting me, did not mention it until I opened the itinerary.  Is this legal."

Use a different travel website
","I booked two flights for my mother and sister to attend my brother's wedding in Moscow. Unfortunately my mother fell and broke her ankle two weeks ago, was forced to have an operation and told she would not be able to fly. My mother is 72 years old and is recovering from an operation to remove a brain tumour last year. I contacted the airline who said that a refund may be possible with supporting medical evidence but this would have to be done through Expedia. I called Expedia last Saturday, spent nearly half an hour on hold only to be told they couldn't get through to the airline (despite me having spoken to the airline half an hour earlier). I was told I would be called back but that I should also email Expedia, documenting what happened with a scanned copy of the medical certificate. Fast forward to Wednesday and I received no call or response to my email. I then spent nearly an hour and a half on hold to Expedia once again, only to be told I would have to be given a call back the same day as they could not reach the airline. I was even asked if I could provide alternative numbers for the airline - the same airline that Expedia act as agents for! No surprises that I still have had no response to my emails or calls and I think time has now run out to claim a refund.Please go somewhere else to book your flights."

Bad bad bad when it comes to refunds due to their own fault
","I booked a pair of tickets and was told it the fare price included baggage. When I received my confirmation email and logged onto BA.com i could see it was a hand baggage only fare. I called Expedia immediately and was advised to book and pay for the baggage myself and once I had an email receipt from BA I would receive a refund. I have spent many many hours on the phone and have sent no less then 41 emails to try and get my refund. All the customer service agents tell me they have all the info and it has been approved and will be processed immediately but its 2 months later and I still have not had a penny back. Just want to let everyone know.Hi, Just want to say it is now 24 hours since I emailed Stuart Newman on the email address given and have had no response other then an automated reply saying this will be passed to the priority escelation team. I will let everyone on here no IF AND WHEN i receive a refund.So finally an update, I did get a refund, they took my card number but then refunded to a different account that I had given them earlier. I had to wait about 3 weeks after kicking up a big stink both here on this site and elsewhere and bombarding the complaints email. Bottom line even though I got my refund the whole hassel was NOT worth the holiday booking with them. If you want to have an uncomplicated easy journey and holiday DO NOT BOOK WITH EXPEDIA"

Expedia let me down
","Dear Customer Support Team, On Thursday July 9th, 2015, I was booked to fly on Delta between London Heathrow and Boston. When I arrived at the airport, I was told that my second middle name was incorrectly registered as my surname . I was told that I had an hour to contact Expedia and ask for a new ticket to be issued with the correct surname, but that this should be accomplished in about 10 minutes.I immediately called the helpline and was put through to Expedia's call centre in India. The assistant was painfully slow and finally issued me a ticket with a new and still incorrect surname. There was now no time for me to correct this and I was denied access to my flight. I therefore had to book a new return ticket with BA and missed an onward flight within the United States,which also had to be rebooked. Expedia also charged me ?40 for the privilege of having my ticket reissued incorrectlyWhen I called the call centre again, they acknowledged that the ticket had been issued with the wrong surname and said that they would check the recordings of the call to see if the assistant was at fault. In that case they would send me a full refund for the wasted ticket. I have yet to hear anything from them.27.7.15: Despite promises from Mr Newman that his Escalation team would contact me this week, I have yet to hear anything from them."

Expedia Scam
","BEWARE OF SCAM BY EXPEDIA. When you book hotel on the phone via expedia, they would enter coupon code without your knowledge. Once you have provided you payment details, they would confirm booking and also send you information on price guarantee where by if you can find like for like booking at a cheap price, they would refund you the difference. But be aware that the price match guarantee would only apply if a coupon is not used and chances are that 48 hrs before you check-in, the price will certainly be cheaper. But because they apply a coupon without your knowledge, they will not price guarantee, hence always inform them not to apply coupons as this is applied automatically. We would have saved over ?250.00 per hotel booking that could have been used for other amenities. If any of the board members of expedia are reading this, you should be ashamed of you self on trying to con peoples hard earned money and if you need to contact me, my case ID is REQ:M-10872151. Be honest and refund what we have asked for. On top of this, expedia were meant to contact me as they have my phone number, but no one has bothered calling me to owe up to the scam."

Hit and Miss!
","I booked via Expedia for many flights and hotels over the past 4 years (part of my job) for over 50 employees. Expedia UK is very hit and miss with their customer service. The agents are usually well spoken and friendly however there's been a few times they have made mistakes which resulted in my colleagues stranded in airports or having to pay out again for new tickets. It then takes months on end to receive a refund. The waiting time is usually quite long before you speak to someone and then it takes around 5 mins for them to bring up your details on their screen and verify the security details. If you already hold a booking and need to make a change or inform of an issue, the agent asks for you to hold the line for '2-4 mins' which is never the case! It takes at least 5-10 mins for them to investigate and then further time to help with the booking. I usually end up spending around 20-40 mins just waiting around. Expedia should improve the quality of their service in this respect."

Expedia are a complete joke of a company!
","After being very excited about a family holiday to Paris, I booked a tour with Expedia online for 4 adults and 2 children totaling ?368.18. I then went to the agency with our printed vouchers only to be told the tour had been cancelled. It was Expedia's responsibility to inform me of this which they failed to do so. I had no knowledge that the tour had been cancelled whatsoever. I phoned them to request a refund. I was told the money would be back in my account within 5-7 days. After waiting a few days and still no sign of the refund, I phoned their ""customer service representatives"" numerous times and keep being told the same story with the same emails. Chasing a refund when Expedia are the ones in the wrong. I have phoned my bank twice who cannot see this amount pending or any record of it, so basically there is no evidence that the refund is being processed as I keep being told by Expedia. 8 days later and words cannot describe how disgusted and disappointed I am with this company. Absolutely ridiculous that they can treat people this way. The money left my account immediately and it is the principle of what has happened. This was meant to be an organised trip for myself and my family. Now I am patiently waiting everyday for the money I worked hard for to come back. I would strongly recommend that people do not use this sham of a company. Please stay clear."

BUT if something does go wrong it's very troublesome trying to sort it out.They misleadingly advertised a BA flight which included a check in bag per person, but once we'd paid for the flight found out that the check in bag wasn't included! After many calls (oh, you'll only get through to an Indian call centre, not to anyone in the UK, and they can't transfer you to anyone in the UK) they eventually agreed to refund to us the extra ?120 we paid to have our bags checked in. Refunds take at least 5 days. But they only refunded ?60, so even more calls and more wasted time speaking to someone in India to get the refund sorted out. The guys in India are courteous, but make promises they don't keep! (As i write this we are still waiting for the balance to be refunded). We used to use Expedia all the time, but after what we have just experienced we will never use them again."

Very Happy Customer!
","Being on a reasonably small holiday budget, the local travel agents were unable to offer myself and my partner a good quality holiday abroad and resulted to suggesting 2 star or less hotels in different locations to where we wanted to go, (usually in very busy tourist resorts which we are not into) because flights cost so much despite their brochures advertising much lower priced package holidays. Instead I looked on Expedia and for the same price the local agents quoted for a two star stay in very cheap European locations we found a four star hotel in our desired destination with flights included on the dates we needed. The flights even left from an airport the agents told us that we couldn't go from. Very easy to use service, fast and well organised. Will use again for future bookings!"

Awful Customer Support
","Had problems with hotel while we were on holiday in Mauritius, had a big chunk of balcony fall down as we were sitting outside which if hit us would have caused serious injury, hotel didn't apologise just said we will get somebody to look at it, when we returned to room we found housekeeping quickly cleaning up the mess, the next day we were offered a new room which was 1 door down still no apology and staff acted as if it was nothing serious and when pressed claimed language difficulties in understanding us. We contacted Expedia for help as we were getting nowhere and no response and again complained when we returned and have sent 3 more emails to various email addresses and still no response. This is a shame as we always used Expedia for our holidays and previous dealings with customer service have been excellent, they have dealt with questioned promptly but this time we are extremely disappointed and will think twice now with booking with Expedia when previously they would have been 1st choice."

Unreliable - let me down twice out of four experiences
","When Expedia works well it does a fine job.  However, I have been burned twice out of four experiences with them, and for that reason I now have serious reservations against using them.  Both my problems have come when booking via the call centre.The first time was when booking easyjet flights for a trip to Barcelona (booking the day before travel due to the death of a friend).  They confirmed on the phone that I was booked on to a flight in the morning; but when I arrived at the airport it turned out that the booking had never gone through, and I had to buy an expensive on-the-spot seat in order to fly.The second time I was booking interconnecting rooms at a Copenhagen hotel, and was assured that the hotel had guaranteed this arrangement by the phone operative, at the price I was paying.  This was even put in writing.  However, after booking, and double-checking with the hotel, they denied ever making the promise, and told me I would have to pay a supplement to have interconnecting rooms!  I had to ring back and cancel my booking through Expedia, and then re-book with the hotel direct (at a higher price).  So much time lost, as well as the money!  I asked to make a complaint, and was told to email.  I have not received a reply to my complaint email 3 days later.In summary, do not trust Expedia to deliver on their promises; and if you ever do have a problem, do not expect them to care or sort it out for you.Avoid."

Would highly recommend this place for this! The lady that showed me up to the room was very happy and was apologetic for the hotel being closed.Breakfast was served downstairs, as there were no signs of a waitress I sat in the breakfast room for 10 mins waiting for someone to advise how to order etc. I then had to go look for the waitress!

Absolutely shocking customer service
","Yesterday I booked a packaged holiday to the Jumeriah Beach Hotel after seeing an offer on the Expedia site that if you stay at the hotel between set dates you would receive an complementary offer of free breakfast and lunch / dinner. After i received my confirmation email last night i noticed that there was no mention of the complementary offer. I immediately contacted customer service to get this checked out. In turns out that the complementary offer didn't exist and that i made it all up, even though i had a screen shot of the page and a url link.   It also turns out that even though i cancelled within 30 minutes of booking the holiday it will take up 5 working days for me to get a refund, which means i can not go ahead and book another holiday with another vendor.As you can imagine i was extremely annoyed and requested a call back from a supervisor at a certain time. Guess what? They never called. So i rang up and actually ended up speaking to someone a little more helpful then the person i spoke to last night. Even though i emailed over a screen shot and url link of the offer page there was still nothing that could be done.Apparently my only option was to a) wait for 5 days for money to be refunded and buy a holiday elsewhere or b) book another holiday with Expedia and only then would the issue get looked into by the technical services team.As you can imagine i was a bit shocked and again requested to speak to someone senior. I was told that someone would call me back at an agreed time.I am still waiting for my call back.Moral of the story pay a bit more and get a decent service."

In the end I gave up on customer support as I was getting nowhere fast.I checked my itinerary and found I had five unbooked itineraries for the same reservation , I deleted four and booked the last one and payed the higher charge which was about nine pounds extra .The only reason I booked with Expedia  on this occasion was that I was familiar with the hotel and even with the extra charge it was still a good deal.However if I factor in my time maybe not ,my advice is beware of the price you see on the screen and only ring customer support as a last resort."

Mine didn't.Having got a good price on the website after logging into members deals and entered a valid 10% discount code,which was accepted,I tried 8 times including on my phone to book and each time it kept sending me back to the payment page and asking me to contact the call centre.I called the call centre to be told the members price on the website was not available to the call centre and he ""guessed"" the price on the site was inaccurate and the live price he had was much higher. I gave up.Returned today to check and the members price was ?5 higher than yesterday and unsurprisingly the still valid 10% code now miraculously worked and I booked at the higher price.If you are going to reject an attempted booking at least give a reason on your website don't just keep sending your customer back to the booking page as if they'd done something incorrectly.I doubt I'll be using Expedia again any time soon in a hurry."

Shocking and upsetting experience
","What a fiasco from Expedia, what was supposed to be a lovely surprise for my husband for our 34th Wedding anniversary turned out to be a horrible and stressful experience of the incompetence of Expedia booking online.  Three times my payment was not processed due to an error on the website, which kept telling me to try again, had to put all the information in three times.  I then gave up and went to Booking.com, where my payment was immediately accepted.Imagine my horror which by luck I had asked booking.com to help make preferences for our stay to make it a special one, by recommending and  booking a restaurant they told me that I had 2 bookings - one with them and one with Expedia.  I started my phone calls to Expedia at 7 in the morning and finished all my calls at 9.45!!!!!  The system had taken my payment, no confirmation sent, clearly on the website it gave an itinerary number but said that the hotel was not yet booked.  Expedia told me that this was none refundable and non cancellable for the 2 nights.  I escalated the call, with huge difficulty as was told the usual story of managers in a meeting!!  Got them to check my bookings, they said there were none.  Got them to call the hotel after I had given them the telephone number (supplied by Booking.com) and then they agreed there was a booking, but if it was my error (clearly not) it would be investigated within 5-10 days. I cancelled the payment with Amex who were great, but still have to wait until it goes on my bill to dispute it.  Now paying interest!!!  Finally rang Expedia again and they offered me compensation in vouchers - now shaking and very stressed.  Then the line was disconnected - no further response from them - what an unprofessional company and unhelpful.  NOT HAPPY."

Good stay - shame about the cot
",We stayed at the hotel for 1 night before departing on a cruise from Oslo. Hotel is in a great location. Comfortable rooms. The only issue we had was we arrived late in the evening and once we found our room we notice that the cot for my 10 month old was missing. After a call to reception and a 20 minute wait and another call to reception they informed me they did not have a cot available. My 10 month old baby had to sleep in bed with me( which does not happen at home) my partner had to sleep with my 11 year old daughter on the sofa bed.

Sadly this meant a frustrating couple of hours setting various options up in multiple tabs while my wife and I try to find the right combination. Just being able to book more than one hotel per booking would have made this so much easier, surely that's possible? Or maybe Expedia don't want to do this because then it would all be counted as a single package and be ATOL protected?Anyway got it sorted in the end but we ended up sourcing part of the holiday elsewhere because of the complexity of doing all with Expedia."

So instead off acing the option to put a deposit and pay the remainder had to pay the whole lot in one hit. Especially as I was booking for 5 people. Online needs option of deposit. Also I booked my one yr old a seat in the flight and Expedia have listed him as an adult which makes me think I'm being charged for an adult seat. They also say ate the rwo room are for two adults and two children which is wrong. The whole thing online is confusing and in plain site incorrect. Annoying. If it was the same price by calling up would call everytime. Oh and they've allovated my child to another passenger! Very angry about that.

So we found our flights on Skyscanner and booked these and the hotel on Expedia separately, costing us ?50 more, overall.  I checked my bank account this morning and over ?1,200 had been taken, in addition to the cost of our holiday. It appears both payments that said they had not gone through, actually had. I have spent a very long time on hold to Expedia today which I'm sure I will be charged for, only to be told that it is a 'connectivity error' between Expedia and the bank and it happens sometimes! I have been told the money will be back in my account in 72 hours, which means I now have 3 days at a loss of ?1,200, through no fault of my own. Needless to say I am incredibly frustrated and unimpressed by the service I have received. The call centre was very unhelpful in explaining to me what had happened, and more infuriatingly, completely unapologetic, considering it was an error on the part of Expedia. I have also now had an email requesting feedback, calling me Nici, which is not my name.

Although it is covered in the backbay map (JUST) the title - Boston- Copley square I thought intimated it would be in the Copley square area!!  I emailed straight away to say I was not happy and am still waiting for a reponse 2.5 days later!!!  I am travelling on my own and paid ?330 for a 2 night stay and expected somewhere central and nice not an INN and not 1.5-2 miles form the area advertised!!  I am extremely unhappy and will never use this service again

Lots of time on hold
","I thought it would be a nice idea to redeem my nectar points, but it ended up being a lot of stress. I spent nearly half an hour on hold with the nectar department, only to have a bad line where I could barely hear the operator. I know this was not my signal as I'd previously made other calls just fine.Once I finally had the voucher I tried to book the hotel but the voucher wouldn't work. I called and spent more time on hold, spoke to one operator who couldn't help and transferred me...cue hold music for 30 minutes. Again, it a was a bad line. Eventually the operator discovered that my nectar points had been added with a particular redemption date rather than immediately. This was a lot of stress I could have done without and I hope the hotel lives up to expedias description."

He did however warn that as the hotel booking was non-changeable he might not be able to help. I was awaiting a complaint but after he rang the hotel he cam back and let me know the hotel had been changed to the right date and that I would even get a ?2 refund being the difference of the charge between the dates.I will be wary using the app or at least triple checking the reservation date, but the service afterwards was excellent!!"

Problem trying to use Nectar Vouchers
","Having exchanged Nectar points for ?100 of Expedia credi I had great difficulty in actually using them for the hotel booking I was trying to arrange to the point where I had to give up and pay the full cost leaving my credit on my account.Although I followed the instructions as well as I was able, at no point in the online booking process did I find an opportunity to use the credit despite using the ""use voucher"" link from the account page.  I wasn't unduly worried until the last stage of the transaction as the instructions state the voucher amount will be automatically deducted at the end - but it wasn't!I rang the Help Line and they told me I needed to have rung Expedia in order to have used the voucher service - that conflicts with previous experience and Expedia's own instructions which clearly stated that vouchers can be used for online bookings. I gave up with the Help Desk as they clearly hadn't got a clue and basically said ""don't worry, you still have your ?100 credit in your account..."" Not a good experience then on this occasion."

","I spent about 8 hours trying, unsuccessfully, to book a hotel and flights through expedia; everytime I put the details in it seemed to 'go through the motions' but I would get the message 'unable to complete your booking at this time'. No explanation as to why.  I ended up having to book the hotel through Expedia and the flights direct from the airline (the same flights I'd tried to book as a package).  The result?  A migraine, an overwhelming sense of frustration, but - on the upside - a better deal than I would have got had the initial booking gone through.  All I wanted was an explanation as to why the booking failed ( I must have tried about 10 times over three days) - it wasn't the credit card, and there were hotel rooms and flights available.  Really, really annoying.  I'd used Expedia before and was very impressed, but sadly this has left a bitter taste.  All that said, it's likely that I'll use Expedia again in the future as they do offer a very good service, usually.  Like I said, an explanation was all I wanted."

2 deluxe rooms for 2 nights or not!
","We arrived to find the hotel overbooked. They blamed Expedia but had clearly only noticed the problem that morning but they did say the same thing happened the week before. They offered us the last two rooms in their sister 4 star hotel fairly close by and obviously at that late stage we accepted. so that was it - problem solved, except the replacement rooms were not nearly as good as those I had booked and were a lot cheaper by about 30% - in this case about 300 euros. I complained and then received apologies, a bottle of champagne and an upgrade to a suite next time we stayed. Having taken my money and given me inferior goods to those I paid for, I really wanted my over payment back or an equivalent reduction next time we stayed.

Dreadful Customer Services (Indian Call Centre)
","The actual process of buying a holiday was quick and easy ... as it always is! For ease of use and the amount of holiday finding tools available, Expedia is one of the best, if not THE Best on the internet.The problem is never the website or the online process ... it's with the Indian Call Centre Customer Services Department!!! I booked a holiday with Expedia, and 24 hours later, I see that the same holiday (same flights, same hotel, same duration) was ?132.41 less. I took a screenshot and used the online form to claim a refund based on ?Best Price Guarantee?. After 24 hours I heard no response, so I rang customer services (Indian Call Centre) who claimed that they did not receive anything, even though I had a confirmation e-mail telling me that they received my claim! I re-sent the e-mail with the confirmation and relevant screenshot. After three days, I still didn?t hear anything back, so spoke to another customer services at: 10:46am 25/05/15 (yet another Indian Call Centre). The guy put me on hold at least 7 times to ?check details? and after 15 minutes of back-and-forth ? he STILL didn?t know what my query was and even got the figures wrong when he did finally offer a refund. I had to almost shout at the guy to give me a refund, as he was unwilling, even though he said he'd give me one. I eventually e-mailed Stuart Newman (western based I assume), and in a matter of days, the problem had been rectified. Whether it was him or not is not known, but the problem was sorted out about 4 weeks after booking. I was fully prepared to march down to London and demand my refund in person at the Expedia London based office if I didn't get my refund. It would have been significantly quicker than arguing with customer services. This is simply dreadful customer service! I know that using Indian Call Centres are cheap, but it's worthless if they don't understand what you're saying. They don't understand their own job and it would have been just as easy to hire chimpanzees to man the phones. The amount of customers you'll lose from infuriating customers simply isn't worth the savings of call centre personnel. I'm not being racist. I'm Chinese myself, but at least I can understand English, unlike the customer services team you currently employ. For the love of God - re-open western based call centres! I'm THIS close to never booking with Expedia ever again thanks to those idiots. I'd rather pay more money knowing that if something goes wrong, I can trust customer services to fix the problem in a timely manner. Good customer service is the difference between successful businesses and unsuccessful ones. Please listen to what I and many other negative reviewers are saying on Trust Pilot!!!"

Could be great, but didn't quite manage it.
","Having booked the Hotel as a detour to London on the way back from a camping holiday. I was made very anxious to be told I would require additional ID in order to access the room! I don't take ID with me on Camping Holidays and living in UK their is no legal requirement for such ID.Also I booked this hotel specifically because of the late arrival time: 10;00pm. But I was then sent an email to say I needed to be there for 9.00pm. So after driving 5 hours to London to see my son for a brief 2 hours, (I only see him twice a year) I had to cut our meeting short by a further 30 minutes in order to get to registration. When I pointed out the mis-information on the web-site they said 'it depends'. Well then they should say 'It depends' on the web site, not falsly grab bookings from people like me.The room was strange, but I could see it being handy with the mini stove, fridge etc.The building felt safe and secure and the location very good.The bed was very uncomfortable.I got up at 4.30 in the morning and left, driving 5 hours home as the bed was difficult to sleep in."

This should be more reward orientated or at least award 100 points per leg of the flight.Similar with hotels, if I book for 2 weeks or 1 night I get the same amount of points.Something to think about maybe."

Misleading....
","I recently decided to book a trip to Thailand for December and over Christmas this year, I had been researching flights etc for a few weeks.I decided that I would make my booking with Expedia as the business class flights were competitive, usually I would book flights direct with the airline such as Virgin Atlantic, however it seems that Expedia undercut the actual airline prices for this route which was great. I noticed when booking that if I booked the flight and hotel I could make savings, even better I thought! I attempted to use the site and found the business class flights and then I was prompted to add a hotel, great but it would only let me choose one hotel for the entire trip, I?m not planning on staying in one place so that wasn?t going to work for me. It would however let me do this if I was flying economy, well that?s not going to happen since I?m 6?4?  I phones the support number to see if there was a way to achieve this and after being on hold for some time I was advised I couldn?t configure a business class flight as a package with a hotel unless the hotel booking matched the flight dates! Great I?m penalised for booking business class!So anyway after this I decided right well I still need the flight and proceeded to book the flight, all this went fine. On the confirmation screen it said ?Because you booked a flight, you qualify for up to 55% off Bangkok hotels. Expires Fri, 12 June (See Hotels Link Followed).? Great I thought this means I will still get a great deal on a package so I proceeded to book the Bangkok Pullman G for ?281. After completing this booking my partner checked the hotel out on Expedia and also entered the dates suprisingly exactly the same price was available even though they hadn?t booked a flight! I felt extremely mislead by the confirmation promise of such a saving because I had booked a flight? Over the years I have made a significant number of Hotel bookings with Expedia both under and this is the first time I have felt mislead, a loss of confidence and disappointment in the Expedia brand and service. Im still awaiting an explanation?"

As from my previous experience, Expedia never bills me separately for admin, tax and fare. He was rude and asked me to do my own calculation first and said expedia did not charge extra. I don't really know what happen but I will wait until all the rest of amount shown on my credit card and if that is not the case, I will ask my bank to dispute it.

I called Expedia and spent another 90 minutes on the phone. In the end, I spoke to a supervisor who promised me he would investigate and call me back. Of course he did not call back, I just got an email saying they had tried to call me, which is rubbish as I was waiting for their call.

?50 voucher swindle
","Expedia gave me a ?50 voucher to use towards a booking due to a big mistake they made. I used the voucher to make a room reservation, but cancelled it so I could rebook a different room type in the same hotel. The credit card refund was issued, but the voucher was not. Customer services refuse to issue me a new voucher no matter what I say. So, I am now down ?50 and a victim of poor Expedia service yet again.** Update 02/06/15**I have been in touch with Stuart and he has been very helpful and quick in resolving the issue for me.

Money Grabbing, Time Wasting Company ""Avoid""
","Before paying for a holiday booking it stated that debit cards did not incur a fee but expedia charged me anyway, I called them before going on holiday and was assured that it would be refunded, after I got back I again checked my account and it still hadn't been refunded, so I phoned them on several occasions and was promised by different managers that it would be refunded but it never made its way into my account, I am still waiting for the refund.If they are prepared to rip someone off for a small amount good luck trying to get back a larger amount! Avoid Expedia and save yourself a lot of time and hassle, there are a lot of good companies out there that are selling holidays at similar prices to them and they do a far better job of it."

THE WORST COMPANY FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE
","If you are one of the lucky ones who never has a problem with a booking then all is good. If unlike me and a multitude of others on here you have had an issue then good luck getting help from Expedia. Been waiting for 2 months for a refund for an extra nights hotel stay which was still taken from us even though we cancelled a month before we left. Keep being promised a call back within 72 hours. Nothing. Keep being told to wait an additional 5-7 days. Nothing. Expedia have admitted we cancelled the booking but are fighting it out with the hotel over who is going to re-imburse us, meanwhile we are still ?160 out of pocket. I am on the phone whilst writing this review and bring told Expedia will contact the hotel again and to wait........ You guessed it, another 5-7 days. I have never had such terrible customer in my 35 years alive. I will never ever use Expedia again!!"

Charged for a hotel booking I have never made
","I have recently made hotel bookings on Expedia, trusted the website, therefore initiated those online payments by debit card. However, those details given for payments were not secure at all. When I went through my bank statement, I noticed one of the payments was made without my knowledge. I have called the bank to clarify this transaction, fortunately Barclays servicing term was really helpful and efficient. The bank staff actually contacted the concerning department of Expedia and checked all the relevant details about my transactions with Expedia. Later found out that the payment was made by mistake from Expedia. The bank kindly inform me that the mistake was made by coincidence. I was not absolutely sure about the formal procedures between the bank and online merchant, which they meant by ""coincidence"", I would understand as careless mistake instead. Nevertheless, I do think Expedia have to take certain responsibilities for such mistake. Those bank details were indeed important, I do accept the risk for making online bank transaction, still the online service provider should exercise their due care to avoid this from happening. It is terrible when the bank told me at the first instance (they of course do make further investigation right after this) that the transaction was duly signed or authorised by me, probably using the security code I have given for the payments I ought to pay. An utterly unpleasant experience."

Unacceptable
","Rented a car through expedia. Chose wv golf or similar for a short hiking trip. On arrival, car rental company told me that expedia booked a fully electrical vehicle instead. This was obviously unacceptable.Had to call expedia and spent over an hour on hold why customer service representatives were asking each other and their managers what to do. In the end expedia agreed to refund the upgrade to a larger vehicle which happened to be 500% of the original price I've paid. Expedia sent out a confirmation email assuring me that the refund will be processed within 5 days.After five days, ther was no refund, so I contacted expedia, spent over an hour on hold and was told that their customer team needs to investigate tge case. They completely ignored the fact that i have provided scans of all original booking documents, receipts and a copy of xpedia email promising the refund. Customer service promised to get back to me as soon as the investigation is over.After not hearing from expedia for few days called them again, had to wait for about an hour, then had to tell the whole stor again, as there was no record of my previous conversation. I was told that the refund is confirmed and will be processed in 7-10 working days.After 10 working days, no refund and no call back from expedia, i have called them again. Had to wait for only 20 minutes this time. Then i had to tell the entire story once again as customer service had a record that my car rental was ""successful"". In the middle of the conversation the customer service representative has put me on hold and then dropped the line.I called expedia again and asked to be transferred to the customer service representative i was previosly talking to. I was told this is not possible even though i have provided representatives name and my itenerary number. I had to explain the whole situation once again and was told that the refund team will be in touch with me in next 24 hours. Left my phone number and hang up,48 hours later no call from the refund team. I called expedia. On hold for Bout half an hour, then explaining the situation to the customer service representative who did not have a clue. Then i was told that my refund will be processes within 5-7 days. I have explained i was waiting for two weeks already, but was told that nothing can be done to speed the process up.Still waiting for a refund, not sure if i will receive it. Might need to take it to the court."

Appalling customer service
","After many years loyal custom, with half a dozen trips a year booked through Expedia, I'm sad to say I will never book, or recommend this company again.Two weeks ago I booked probably the most important trip of my life, my honeymoon, through Expedia.  It was an expensive booking and included flights with BA. Whilst filling in our passport details, the autofill changed one of the passenger names, further up the page, as we were filling in passenger 2 details further down the page. As we proceeded to the payment and confirmation page, all that was displayed was that we were paying for 2 flights and hotels with dates which we checked in case we got it wrong but passenger names were not there for us to double check.Once we got the confirmation email, we could see the mistake and tried to contact Expedia immediately.  But, as it was a bank holiday, there was no reply.  So I spoke to BA who assured me it would be no problem to correct but it would have to be requested by Expedia.And ever since we have been victims of Expedia's appalling customer service, being given many of the same excuses and ineptitude exemplified by other posters: they cannot get through to BA (although we can every time), they have technical problems, systems are down, cannot login, can we wait 3-4 minutes - only to be cut-off 1.5 hours later.Expedia did finally get through to BA, but told me that nothing could be done. When I asked what was the way forward, all the adviser said was that he was unable to advise me on the next action to take or how to resolve the problem. When I asked to speak to a supervisor, he said he didn't have one.Frustrated, I called British Airways again, where the agent very kindly re-assured me that the notes are still on our booking record and he cannot understand why Expedia have not tried to resolve it. Clearly Expedia don't care.  They have made a sale and got their money.  They would rather sell us another ticket instead of correcting this one.So now I'm stuck with a useless flight ticket, and only one valid flight.  It wouldn't be much of honeymoon with only one of us there."

Loyal customer who is extremely disappointed
","I have used Expedia on many occasions for my travels. I have also, with absolutely no hesitation, recommended them to friends and family. Its just a shame that now I have lost all trust and faith in this company.On Apil 7th I travelled to Madrid on a half board basis. It came to light on the first morning that not everything was as it should be. I had been charged for breakfast. I immediately went to reception and they confirmed that my stay was on a room only basis. I phoned Expedia straight a way to get this resolved. The first call I had just explained my situation and was hung up on. I phoned back and the lady at customer services called the hotel's reception. She came back admitting that Expedia had messed up the booking and to keep the receipts for a refund on my return. I was only there for 3 days and I had to spend my first morning phoning Expedia in Spain from my mobile.On my return, I phoned through to customer services and provided them with my receipt as proof for the meals I was charged for. They advised me that a request for the refund has been sent and will be with me in 5-7 working days. I waited and no refund came. I phoned back. They apologised and told me that no request for a refund had been sent. So I had been lied to. They said they will escalate the issue and again the money will be with me in 5-7 working days. Again, still nothing. I phoned back. Another request was sent for a refund and this time I was given a refund code. 5-7 days have been and gone and surprise, no refund. Earlier this evening I called yet again. The advisor put me on hold to speak to the refund department. Twenty minutes later ""they've left for the day"". How many times do I have to phone you just to get the money that is rightfully mine?I understand that company's make mistakes. However, a good company should take actions to rectify the situation. I have never been so disappointed and I will not rest until a get a resolution"

NEVER USE
","Absolutely appalling customer service. I cancelled a hotel booking after expedia failed to authorise a 'best price match guarantee' (with their own website, having been assured by the manager over the phone that this would be accepted). Hotel far cheaper booking direct with the hotel. Have been waiting for the refund for 3 weeks now - every time I phone they tell me to wait an extra 5-7 days. I have spoken to managers with no avail. I have emailed continuously but they rarely reply to these. Each time I have phoned the wait is 40 minutes plus.Having looked at online reviews I see this is a recurring problem where customers fail to get refunds for months. DO NOT trust them with your money. You will certainly be able to get a better deal going direct and without all the hassle. Their 'deals' are not deals. And attempting to get a refund is just not worth it. I also love the way the customer service team responds to positive comments on here but not negative ones. Says a lot for their customer service. As does the fact that I joined this site only to be able to write this review. If I could give zero stars I would. You have been warned."
1191,"Chris,Thank you so much for the positive feedback and I'm glad to hear that everything went well with your refund etc.Yes, some customers do have issues, unfortunately with the hundreds of thousands of bookings we process things can at times go wrong, but as you can see from the negative posts below I do make my details publicly available so I can personally ensure that when things do go wrong we can react as quickly as possible to rectify.I would stress aswell that although our score on Trustpilot doesn't look great it's based on a total of 548 reviews (a very very very small percentage of our total bookings)Kind Regards & Thank You!Stuart NewmanDirector of Customer Experience, Expediaemail - stnewman@expedia.com",5,2015-05-11T20:01:42.000+00:00,"
Booking honeymoon with problems, resolved quickly inc refund.
","Booked a honeymoon to the Maldives on Thursday 7th June. Due to not understanding what an additional hotel charge was shown on line, I phoned the call centre to find it was seaplane transfer which is organised by the hotel. As I was on the phone I decided to complete my booking with the agent, and gave my holiday details.Once the call was finished, my itinerary was sent to me, and I could see the outbound flights were wrong as I had a stop over in Qatar of 19 hours, which I did not want.I tried calling to sort this out however the system were down to amend and change bookings, and had been for hours. I had apprehensions  about how this was going to go, and was promised a call back once the system was up and running again.I did receive that call and the agent tried to amend the flights, however unfortunately he couldn't and had to cancel the whole itinerary and issue a refund. Having seen the issues on here earlier in the day regarding refunds, I started to fear the worst, but went ahead with the cancellation as the honeymoon was not how I intended it to be. Within 10 mins of the call I had my refund email confirmation.I re-booked the following morning and that booking went without a hitch, and had confirmation emails from the hotel as well as the airline.I have today received a full refund for the booking on the 7th to my credit card as promised.I felt compelled to write this review as I consider that I have received excellent service from Expedia over a booking issue, where my terms were that I could not cancel or amend the trip. I think that not enough people take the time to write a review when things go right for them, and the reviews end up being biased on the negative side.whilst I consider people clearly do have problems with Expedia, I have had a good experience with their customer service team, and I would recommend using them, even though they have a low score on this site."

Diabolical company!
","A couple of months ago my mother wanted to book flights going with her friend and husband  and then they would return after 5 weeks and my mum to return 3 and half months later. I knew if I tried to book it online the prices may suddenly change so I picked up the phone to their customer services they can do the booking for me. I was on the phone to them for 70 minutes doing all the bookings and the names etc. as far as I was concerned it was all done. My mum wanted to take an extra suitcase with her as she is going for a long time and I went onto the site to purchase an extra suitcase allowance for the flight there. Low and behold after I booked the suitcase and paid ?40 i saw just below it that there are no checked in baggage!,,,,,,I thought well that's ok I am sure they can listen to the call and hear that at no point was I advised that the booking is hand luggage only. There is no way someone would book hand luggage only for 3 and half months and the other passengers too for 5 weeks. Well I thought wrong order of events so farFirst call, I am sorry but we do not keep recordings for more than 28 days the phone goes silent. Sorry we are not liable you have to pay the difference. Phone goes silent. Can not do anything. After expressing my anger he offered to put me through to his supervisor after being put on hold for several times for unacceptable durations. Supervisor says the same thing and the phone is cut off!Second callI am very sorry,let me help you I can not find any notes on your booking.....phone cut offThird call Explained my story, I am very sorry but this booking was done online and not on the telephone and so we are not liable. This booking can only be done online and not on the phone (total shock). I am being called a liar!!! Phone cut off Fourth callAfter explaining my story again....I am very sorry, we will get the call listened  to and if the advisor did not tell you about the hand luggage only then we are liable and will pay the difference. A sigh of relief but still frustrated as why did they just do that in the beginning...phone cut off but they are looking into it right? No!Fifth call todayOn hold, then cut offSixth callI am sorry but your compliant has been escalated but my colleague has already explained that  the booking was done online. But I said I did not do it online I was on the phone for 70 mins, I have it on my bill. No they can't accept this either because they think that I spend 70 minutes on the phone to them not to book tickets but to talk about the weather and such! This company is a complete joke, customer service, joke. I now have to wait 48 hours as it has been escalated to the escalations team. I do not want to even get into the English language spoken.I'm not holding my breathe for them to come back to me by Sunday. Overall I do not recommend anyone to book anything from this company not even to book a local day trip!I will come back with an update for anyone interested!"

I will now avoid Expedia at all cost
","I have recently booked a holiday for my family and I to Disneyland Paris.I booked the trip on the basis of their 'Best Price Guarantee' covering our trip, if we were to find it cheaper elsewhere.I checked our trip the next day on a competitor's website and found the exact same hotel and flights for around ?50 cheaper. With this, I submitted a guarantee claim through the Expedia website with all of the details. This was replied to the next day, stating that they could not honour the claim as they could not find the same flights as the ones booked through Expedia. I responded with a screenshot of the cheaper price with all of the details of the holiday booking on it, and it was a further two days before my claim was rejected again, but this time they stated that it was due to the fact that I had also booked some attraction tickets at the time of my booking, meaning that the comparison holiday that I had found cheaper was not of the 'same itinerary'. Having checked the T&Cs of this offer prior to booking, I was confident that the attraction tickets were not going to affect any future 'Best Price Guarantee' claim, as it is not stipulated in the terms that it would null the right to claim.After over a week of frustrating and lengthy phone calls to overseas call centres, with staff who did not understand English well enough to to be able to help me with this issue, I finally got to the answer that ""you cannot speak to the best price guarantee team, you can only email them"". Helpful.With my emails to them being completely ignored, I sent an email to their head office in America (Nevada?). After a week or so, this was responded to, and I had someone from the 'UK customer relations team' looking into my complaint. It took them a week to ""investigate"", to then come back to me and say exactly the same thing that the 'best price guarantee team' had said : ""the claim cannot be upheld due to the fact that I have attraction tickets within my booking"".The fact of the matter remains: the guarantee states that if you find the same holiday (flights +hotel) for a cheaper price, then they will refund the difference. I did find this, and they hide behind something which isn't actually stipulated within their T&Cs in order to reject the claim. I had only booked the attraction tickets through them for ease, as it was easier to have it all booked in one place. Those were an ""extra"" added at the checkout, the same as if I were to book car hire or their travel insurance: would those nullify a ""best price guarantee"" also? My claim was only for the price of the hotel and flights combined. It is clear from my itinerary to see the total cost of the flight and the hotel, so it would have been clear for Expedia to see that I had indeed found the same package for cheaper - the attraction tickets hold no relevance to this.This company is a sham. What they are doing is fraudulent : providing a service on the back of a promise that they then don't uphold. They are not regulated by anyone; they have no ombudsmen watching over them like regular travel agents do (ABTA). I have reported their practices to trading standards, but I don't expect that to go anywere - they're such a huge company, they can do what they want.Their prices may be cheaper than others, I'm not debating that, but consider whether that small saving is worth it in the long run if it all goes a little pear-shaped. I'll certainly be booking through a reputable company the next time I come to purchase a holiday. The Internet is absolutely flooded with cases that have gone wrong with Expedia, as are their social networking pages (Facebook and Twitter).Be careful. Book using a credit card. Thoroughly research prior to giving these cowboys any of your hard-earned money.Edit: It now appears that Expedia are getting people to review on here to raise their scores somewhat. Don't be fooled people. I'm still trying to sort out my holiday with them, months after booking! They're all liars and none of them have a clue what they're doing!Also nice to see that they can't be bothered to reply to my review right here - says a hell of a lot."

Eventually after getting hold of the owner of the B&B in Whitley Bay, we discover that actually her husband had passed away and she had had to close the hotel altogether (thanks Expedia for making us look heartless...We had to retreat very quickly).So there we were embarrassed but still with no confirmed hotel...We waited...and waited.....eventually after my other half emailing the CEO and complaining on Twitter etc we booked somewhere else (at twice the cost due to the short notice). We received a refund for the initial booking but no actual reply to our emails, apology or explanation whatsoever.Shoddy service ...I will NEVER use this comapny again and will make sure that everyone knows about it"

Expedia customer support - ATROCIOUS!
","I have used Expedia many times and, thankfully,  have never had cause to contact their customer support before now.  On March 11th I contacted Expedia to report a very bad experience with a hotel booked through Expedia. The process was laborious and involved me hanging on the phone for 40 minutes (on 3 occasions!)  whilst Expedia tried (to no avail) to contact hotel manager. Each time Expedia staff told me that they woudl deal with the matter and get back to me within 36 hours but failed to do so. Each time (despite me citing an Expedia Case ID number) I was asked to recount my complaint from scratch. Despite Expedia's promise each time that this time they would deal with it nothing was done. . I left the matter until I returned home 4 weeks later and contacted Expedia again.  Surprise surprise still nothing had been done and I was asked to recount the complaint from the beginning yet again! I finally managed to get a response from Expedia on the 13th April telling me they would look into my complaint. What had they been doing since the 11th March???  Anyway, I haven't heard from Expedia since the 13th April so issue still unresolved. This has put me off ever booking through Expedia again!  Shame really... the matter could have so easily been handled differently"

Worst customer service I have ever experienced
","I had some major issues when booking my tickets online so ended up having to call them to book the fights.Between the time it took from first attempting to book online through to getting my itinerary sent to me, I ended up needing to make three separate complaints (thought, I was also attempted to complain about the 'on hold' time that I spent while trying to sort things out.  I think I have amassed more than an hour on hold/in a queue in total).I was told during two separate phone calls that my complaint was being escalated and they'd be in touch within 48 hours.  THREE MONTHS later I am still trying to get them to deal with my complaints (I have had one response to one of my three complaints).Will be following up the phone calls and emails with a letter.On the plus point, the people I spoke to on the phone were polite."

Worst customer service in history
","Booked a flight for two people on a hours day evening from london to LA and on the Friday received an email saying the flight had not been confirmed and to call up to get them booked. Spoke to someone and they advised me to go to the airlines website and book the same flight through them and expedia would pay the difference. So the exact same flight offering the same luggage requirements was ?250 more per person but the flight I tried to book the previous day had only gone up by ?50 pp. I rang back to double check what they were telling me to do was correct but I suggested that it made more sense to re book through expedia and they just pay me the ?100 difference.After some confusion which I think was a little lost in translation the flight was eventually booked at a ?100 more than the night before and I was told this would be received in 5 days. A week later and no refund so I emailed the email address I was given to which I had no response, it has now been 4 days since this email was sent.Have just phoned up again to be put on hold for nearly half an hour and to be told by a gentleman that he was unable to tell me why it had not gone through and he would need to contact another department.... Via email..... And that he would need between 24-48 hours to do this. This was money I had in a separate account to book my return flight, it has now been 10 days without this been transferred back to me and prices of flights will keep going up. Quick enough to take my money in the first place. Truly terrible service and will not be using in the future."

Expedia - Lost in translation
","Wanted to book a trip for 8 people, unable to do this online , so called their helpline. Price had increased over the phone, even though I had it front of me online at the lesser cost. Expedia agent got 3 of the 8 names wrong, they are trying to charge me ?330 to rectify their mistake, also charged me credit card surcharge when I paid by debit card, and I asked for 4 twin rooms, got 3 twin and 1 double. I called back immediately to inform them of their spelling mistakes (once I'd received the email confirmation), they said they would escalate the complaint to their "" escalations"" team, that was a week ago, have heard nothing!

Online experience is fine...the contact centre is a joke though!
","While Expedia's online experience is fine, the contact centre (which I assume is in India) is DIRE, close to the worst I've ever had the misfortune of speaking with. I had a very simple request, namely to convert some Nectar points into an Expedia voucher to use in an online hotel booking. This took around FOUR calls to the incompetent fools in the contact centre.The first two, I was told by the agents that they could not do it (despite me calling the correct number from the Nectar website) and promptly transferred to a line that simply rang out. The third call I was met with the same response and transferred to a technical support team! Then finally, on the fourth attempt, I spoke with a lady who was frankly as thick as a plank and about as useful as a chocolate teapot...at no point did she convey that she remotely understood what was going on, while at the same time it was evident she paid absolutely no attention to what I, the customer, was saying. This ended up with me getting her to transfer me to another member of her team who, FINALLY, knew what he was doing.It's not good enough, I have better things to do than waste an hour of my life on the idiots clearly employed to cut costs. The sooner Expedia enables an online capability to transfer Nectar points to Expedia vouchers, the better."

Expedia Escalation - What a Joke - However later suprised
",This has got to be ranked up there with the worst companies to deal with in terms of customer service - I have booked a holiday on the phone as i was unable to apply a voucher on-line - When on the phone the price went up considerably i was told the voucher had been applied - get email thru - guess what - no voucher applied - several phone calls later and emails - nothing - no callbacks - i am currently hanging on the phone now 22 minutes and counting and I havent even spoken to anyone yet. An escalation case was raised and they were apparently going to pull recording of conversation off so that i get my money i am owed - nothing - absolutely abysmal -I then received a call from the refunds department after posting on here and emailing a contact stu newman - I was duly refunded Was hard work though - perseverance

Poor service
","The prices increased whilst entering credit card details. Clicked on it without realising. Called customer services to be told that it is in the terms & conditions for website.They also offered return flight with different luggage allowance. Called customer services when airline website said no checked in luggages. Was confidently told that if I turned up the airline will check in. Informed by airline check in desk that this is common issue for Expedia customers. Complained to customer services regarding the entire experience to be told that it is in the small print that it is the responsibility of customer to check and make sure the luggage allowance when using website. They only guarantee this if the booking is made through the phone.The alternative was easy jet which had a transparent website and at the time of booking would have cost me ?50 extra. I eventually spent ?100 on luggage and had the hassle of calling customer services from abroad. More I felt annoyed for an hour, before deciding it was a sunk cost.I am not sure what service Expedia offers if they can't even match flights for customers. They are betting on the inability of people to learn quickly from their experience."

Over Charging
",I have a similar experience to Sharon Xuereb below. I was trying to book a flight and hotel from UK to Boston MA but the Expedia web site stated there was a problem with my credit card as I tried to book. I phoned the Expedia help line who informed me the price had gone up since my online attempt and blamed the airline. The guy took all my details again but when I came to pay informed me the price had risen yet again - so from my initial online search in the space of 30 mins the price had risen twice by a total of ?70.I gave up at this point and booked with British Airways the same flights and hotel which turned out to be ?400 cheaper than Expedia.I might be naive but I though Expedia was supposed to save consumers money - not charge them extra!

First Time had to use Customer Service and it is Dreadful!
","Firstly i have to say i have been using Expedia.co.uk for a number of years and have never had any problems. However just back from a recent holiday to New Zealand where we had booked to go Skydiving. The trip had to be called off due to adverse weather and the company told me to contact Expedia directly with regards to a refund.So far after 3 long phone calls i am no further forward. First phone call on Wednesday the 1st of April and was informed it was being refunded and would be credited to my credit card in 5-7 working days. Great! 7 working days later no credit. Phoned  Sunday the 12th of April. Was informed reservations was shut on a Sunday but would email me to confirm the refund was going through the follwing day. I have heard nothing! Third phone call made today. The gentleman i spoke to tried to contact the vendor, but couldn't get through, hardly surprising as it was 1.40 AM in New Zealand at the time. So apparently he is going to call me back within the hour.Why is it so difficult to get a refund? I have used Expedia for a number of years and spent a lot of money via their website. I have to say i am very disappointed with the way I am being treated. Please sort it out."

Poor customer service - although resolution reached
","Made a booking on the phone to Expedia who I've been using for years without problems. When I got my booking confirmation email I realised they had made a mistake with my flights. I called back immediately but was told it would take 72 hours to resolve. I called 3 days later to find out what was happening and was told I'd get a call back within 2 hours which never came. After calling again and being put on hold for ages while they found a senior manager, he told me that he couldn't resolve this and it had been escalated to a team who would come back to me in 48 hours. I just cannot seem to get through to anyone who can help or give me a straight answer. I've wasted lots of time, all because of their mistake. The organisation is faceless and I've been dealing with Indian call centres who struggle to understand. I've emailed Stuart Newman but not yet had a reply. Getting very irate now and unlikely to use Expedia again unless they resolve this promptly and with sincere apologies.Update:Managed to get hold of someone later on the same day who has rectified the flights - but had to pay fare difference! It was that or wait 3 more days for a refund with the wrong flights, and I wasn't confident anyone would ever come back to me - the guy I got hold of seemed to know what he was talking about and was genuinely empathetic. I do feel like I've paid for their mistake but at least I know I'm getting the right flights now. He reduced the charge and threw in breakfast at the hotel, but have once again emailed Mr Newman and will now have to try and get compensation. I am still rating them one star, but if the resolved to my satisfaction I will update. However, their general processes and standards of customer service need a serious overhaul. I think I only got my 'sort of' resolution through being incredibly persistent and tenacious!Further update:Following my emails to Stuart Newman (who did not respond personally) which were escalated, I had a call from a manager (again at the Indian call centre) the day after I had paid the fee to correct the booking. They have now refunded the change fee so I am now paying what I originally paid for what I thought I was buying. I am grateful for this and glad the escalation worked. Despite this, fact I had to escalate in this way due to my lack of confidence in them, does not reflect well. However, they've now said that they won't pay for breakfast (they said that I could choose for them to do so, but I wouldn't receive the refund on the change fee). While I'm not going to make a big deal about it and consider the matter closed, it does reflect a mean spirited attitude. It would have been an appropriate and not hugely expensive 'sorry for the inconvenience' goodwill gesture in addition to just making things financially right. So, while the resolution is satisfactory, which is why I have upped them to two stars, I would be unlikely to use Expedia again and certainly not if I had to deal with their customer service centre.There are so many other travel companies out there offering the identical products with far better customer service.While people who have had a good experience rarely take the time to review, meaning that this site will always be skewed against the companies, the comments on this Expedia forum are incredibly consistent. It's rarely the products, but the level of customer service and approach to problems that is the issue. It really cannot be that hard to fix with better training, more empowerment of staff and a renegotiation of their massive buying power with the airlines and hotels to ensure a window of flexibility to correct mistakes. On the other hand, perhaps they make enough money that it's simply not that important to them."

Holiday booking from HELL
","I booked online with Expedia and was unable to locate my booking with Virgin Atlantic. On contating Virgin i was advised to go back to Expedia, so I contacted expedia to be told that I had made a mistake spelling my forename. Well I couldnt argue with this as mistakes happen. I then paid ?30. to add an i into my name Christina. A couple of months later I deceided to contact Expedia to upgrade from Economy seats to Premium Economy due to a worsening health issue which my spine. I paid the ?550 to the company who is in charge of all communications with the tour operator. On arrival at the airport I made my way to the Premium Economy check in desk to be turned away and told that there was a problem with my booking. I then went to the virgin Desk where they tried to sort this matter out. Virgin Atlantic staff were absolutely fantastic they contaxted Expedia and was on the phone for over two hours to try to sort this out. in the end they the Virgin advisor advised me to pay for the upgrade again and then to communicate with Expedia as Expedia had failed to pay the ?550 over to their company for the upgrade (eventhough I had paid them 6 weeks before the holiday). I followed the advise of the Virgin atlantic reprasentative. I then sent a letter of complaint to their London address. I waited over one month for a communication to say that they had even received the letter of complaint. Nothing, I then contacted Expedia to be fobbed off by a very rude lady that it was not their fault but Virgin Atlantic. I advised that I made my booking and had a  contract with their company to book my holiday and upgrade. In the end I put the phone down on her as she was so rude. I then contacted the compnay on April 6 to speak with somebody again. This time I had a gentleman on the phone who was equally as defensive of their company. I then threatened that I would take this to the small courts as I wanted money back immediately and compenssation for my discomfort of haveing to stand by a representatives desk for over two and the embarrasement of being turned away from the Premium Economy desk as if i had done something wrong. I was then put on hold again. I was put on the phone to a floor manager. He was very very rude from the onset of the call and told me I couldhave ?280 back I asked him how when I had paid their company ?550 for an upgrade did he think that I was only going to get ?280 returned. I told him I wanted the money which i paid at the airport of ?836 back and compensation for the way I had been treated by his company. he told me after much disagreement that he would arrange for the ?836 to be refunced in the next 5-7 working days I then said that I should be compensated for all the other things. he said in not so many words no way youve had it. I have already written to watchdog about this company as there is no where that you can speak to a British advisor that knows the system of the UK. I am now looking for a holiday obudsman. I then asked him to put something in writing and he put ""As per conversation thi is an email to confirm that we will refund you ?836.00 gbp in next 5-7 days in the same card. How rude NO APPOLOGY  for one of their advisors incompetence in the way that the whole thing has been handled."

Obviously Emirates are partly to blame but the fact that Expedia refused to take any ownership was extremely annoying. I paid Expedia for a particular trip, this has changed due to know fault of my own, I would expect my booking agent to resolve this and also arrange some sort of refund/upgrade yet I've been offered nothing, no apology, no sorry and now I'll have to pay the hotel for an additional day!

Failure to book flight almost ruined holiday
","EDIT: New problems with expedia, will post a separate review.EDIT: Upgraded my original one star review to three stars after they sorted out my issue. I'll leave the issue on here for reference but after posting here they got in touch and sorted out my problems efficiently and nicely and compensated me appropriately. I shouldn't have had to post in public about this but once I did their resolution was good - so now they get more stars.Original post :-My experience with expedia so far has been poor.1) I booked a flight and hotel. After a week I'd not received any booking code for the flights or paid for them (only the hotel) so I emailed and then called twice to confirm they were booked.2) I was assured that yes they were booked and showing on the system. I asked about the flight booking ID I needed to book luggage and was told I'd need to call norwegian airlines directly about this.3) I called them, and was told that without a booking number there was nothing they could do to help me.4) I send a message via webform asking about this to expedia, and after a week had had no response so I called again. I was again told that the flights were definatly booked and all was fine. But when they tried to get me the confirmation number eventually after about 45 minutes on hold I was told that actually there was a problem, the flights were showing as booked but in fact had not been booked with the airline.5) I was told that they couldn't sort it out in customer services so they'd transfer me to sales. They put me on hold for about 5 minutes and I was connected to sales who appeared to know nothing about my issue and couldn't seem to either hear or understand me properly. The call was then disconnected.** it's a good job I repeatedly queried the flights as I was repeatedly told they were booked. If I hadn't we would have turned up at the airport and had no flights ... ***6) I called back later that evening and had to explain the issue again that I had a hotel but the flights were not booked. I was put on hold while they looked into it. After 30 minutes on hold the call dropped. At this point I decided I'd just book my own flights instead as I no longer have any confidence in expedia.7) I called up the next day to confirm the flights were not going to be booked and that the hotel part of the reservation was confirmed. I was told it was.. But honestly I find it hard to trust this now.8) I tried to ask on the website form where I should send my complaint to as I'm really very unhappy about this as it's taken about 4 hours of my time, expensive phone calls, and then after all that I've had to arrange my own flights anyway. However the webform now accepts my question and then *emails* me an internal error message from their computer systems.9) As the webform doesn't work I called asking for details of where I should address my complaint to (email or postal address). As soon as I asked the question the call was dropped. Maybe a coincidence but given the rest I have my doubts.Really this whole thing has been very painful. I've had to book my own flights which cost me more, and I still have doubts that the hotels are booked...Perhaps I had a bad experience but I find it very hard to recommend anyone uses them for anything as they seem to have tried very hard to ruin my holiday and make it very hard to complain."

Expedia Nectar points are one big Con!!!

Purchased BA flights for skiing holiday in Austria with Expedia- no indication that these were hand luggage only until confirmed flight with BA! Very concerned if this will be resolved in time...
","We made 2 bookings with Expedia for a total of seven BA return flights to Salzburg flying this Saturday some time ago. This is a skiing holiday so we all need to take hold luggage. We all fly regularly and are used to online booking where additional hold luggage has to be booked and paid for seperately. An initial information box showed that on this BA flight hand luggage and a first checked bag was free within the price. There was no indication onscreen, on the confirmation email or on the Expedia Itinery that in fact these were hand luggage only tickets. When we confirmed the flight on BA website it stated that these were in fact hand luggage only tickets!! We estimate that this may cost upwards of ?500 to pay for our luggage at the airport! I spent yesterday morning trying to speak with Expedia (with an amount of frustration) but have raised an 'escalation' which I am told will be dealt with within 48-72 hours. We are due to fly in four days so there is considerable time pressure. There is a huge amount of comment online about other people's similar experience and so it is clear to me that this is not an uncommon situation. I was told yesterday that there was little Expedia could do as it was more than 28 days since we purchased tickets but the point is we could not have known until we checked in with BA since Expedia had not made it clear at any stage!!!

Expedia - took our hotel fee without booking our stay!
","Our recent trip booked to Moscow became a disaster after Expedia failed to secure our booking at the Marriott in Red Square. Consequently, as the Marriott had no knowledge of our booking, we were denied our Russian visas as we needed a 'letter of invitation' from the Marriott to secure a visa into Russia.It is appalling that after several email and phone complaints, Expedia have not got back to us regarding this matter. Expedia have taken our money that we paid for our 'non-existent' hotel, AND we lost our flight money as we were denied a visa. We will never be using Expedia again!"

Non existent support after being charged twice for car hire.
","Booked a holiday to Fuerteventura which included car hire for ?75.After returning home I discovered a charge for ?135 on my credit card by the hire car company. I called Expedia who said they would investigate.A month later I called again & nothing had been done. I supplied info to them that they should already have had re: car hire. A couple of weeks later they called me back to say the car hire company say everything is in order, as I presented my credit card & signed the agreement when asked. This of course is normal for the deposit before leaving with the car.I have just received an email from Expedia another month later, and only then after I emailed them for an update, only to give me the same response, & that they consider the matter closed.So not only have I paid twice, but have been charged more the second time, for the car hire organised through Expedia who are not going to reimburse me.Rip-off!!"

How creative Expedia.co.uk is for fooling customer in such a variety method
","Now I will pass over this issue to third party.  As of today, no refund made.   The transaction detail Expedia rejected to provide, just now they opened the card numbers by phone call, which is wrong card number telling me it is korean card.   On top of it,  they say this booking was made last year!  The airline company of this ticket executed immediately the refund to the same card used for this ticket.  How Expedia after three weeks come up to me saying wrong card number telling me it is korean card?  What's the logic or manipulative purpose behind this? Dear Mr. StuartExpedia said the refund has been credited in my account but my bank has not received it for 16 days.   Expedia keeps rejecting to send me transaction details that my bank require to trace it.   Why can't you provide it if it is truly made? This is a series of fooling customers in different methods!

Worst customer service, misleading 'coupons', unexplained charges, overcharged admin fee's, no replies / resolutions, account details wrong
","From the initial booking, there has been nothing but problems with Expedia.co.uk, no replies or ownership of problems.   I have never given a 1 star review but to be honest this company isn't even worth that 1 star!	Very misleading voucher codes on the Expedia main internet page One of the first things I saw when looking on the Expedia website was a voucher code which popped up for ??100 off any flights & hotels deal over ?1000?.  With my quote coming in at approximately ?1100, I proceeded to the online checkout and entered the code, unfortunately this didn?t work.  Thinking this may have been a possible issue with the website I rang Expedia to complete the booking.  After being left on hold and spending about 30 minutes on the phone, I was told I could not use this voucher code as my trip did not meet the ?criteria? set by Expedia.  I was amazed to hear this considering there was absolutely no mention of terms and conditions or any small print on the voucher, or even anywhere else on the website after several searches.  I find this completely mis-leading and very falsely advertised, to be honest I probably wouldn?t have booked my chosen trip had I known the voucher to be a complete con.  	Obscene charges to change the flights for my trip and very poor explanationsUnfortunately due to the nature of my booking being a surprise gift, I was unaware of any issues which may affect the booking on my partners behalf.  I attempted to change the outbound flight to one day earlier and I was told this would cost ?100.10p per person.  I could not believe this charge, I had booked the trip less than seven days ago before changing the flights, with a departure date of almost four months away!  ?100.10p for an ?admin? charge is totally unjustifiable.  Unfortunately when I asked why this was the case, the Expedia advisor told me over the phone it was not their ?admin? charge, but that of Emirates?.  My next call was to Emirates? office in London where they then told me the complete opposite.  Emirates ensured me that the ?200.20p charge was nothing to do with them, in fact, they were unable to alter the booking at all and that the outbound flight could only be done by the travel agent (Expedia).  Emirates could only help with any element of the booking once we had begun the trip, i.e, once we had arrived in Dubai.  Somewhere between Expedia and Emirates there is a mass of confusion and a lack of real truth, after contacting Expedia again I was told point blank that they had a ?no fee? policy in place for changes to bookings.  I am still no further forward as to where my ?200.20p would be going for changing the flights!  It is probably also worth mentioning that both flights were no different in price when checked as a ?new customer? on the Expedia website. 	Incorrect credit card charges for these additional changesAfter having no choice but to pay the additional charges, I was totally shocked to discover that when going to pay my credit card bill that Expedia had massively overcharged me, and not only that but also incorrectly charged me!  When I agreed to pay the charges for changing the flights and adding on an extra nights hotel stay, the advisor I spoke to was very clear about what I needed to pay - ?100.10p per person for the flight alterations and ?80.99p for the hotel (he also used some kind of offer code on the hotel to reduce it to this price) giving a total of ?281.19.  After logging in to pay may credit card bill I found I had two transactions for Expedia (not including my initial trip payment) totalling ?381.29.  After calling the Expedia helpline, I was told that he (the advisor) would have to submit a request for my refund of ?100.10 which could be done in seven days - this has still not happened after 66 days!   	Failure to update my booking / itinerary when I log into my Expedia accountEach time I have spoke to Expedia on the phone, I have asked for my online account to be updated to the correct itinerary details, this has still not happened.  I receive the correct itinerary as an email, however the Expedia account never seems to update.To be totally honest, I feel completely let down by Expedia and their lack of customer care and regret booking this trip at all.  I have now spent over ?1500 on this trip due to having no other option but to continue paying charges etc?  Unfortunately the cancellation charge was also completely obscene at over ?600 so I am tied in.  Thanks Expedia!!!"

","* What would you do if you booked a car on expedia, you then got to the airport, and they tell you they have given your car away to someone else? * We were told there was a 2 hour window within which to pick up the car, despite this not been written ANYWHERE on our terms and conditions. What would they do if your flight was late?* Spent 2 hours on the phone to the expedia helpline (1.5hr on hold) then to be told that there was nothing they could do. * Surely they could just rent you another car that they had, for the same price? Or put you in the direction of a partner company who could offer you a deal? Or pick one up the following day? None of these were given to us as an option. * We were told that our only option was to go and rent another car from a separate company on the day - bearing in mind we were in Switzerland, it was 5 times as expensive!* We complained about 2 weeks ago, and all you get is an email from someone telling you that they are 'escalating' your complaint to someone or other.

VERY FRUSTRATED
","I am flying next Wednesday to Venice having booked flight and hotel through expedia. Confirmation for booking from expedia had correct name on it so thought all was well. Today went to print off my e ticket from Ba and my name was incorrect. Rang through to customer services at expedia and was told that although the name was incorrect on the e ticket ba had the correct name on the booking and it was all ok there would be no problem. Wasn't really happy with this so rang through to BA to check and again was told this wouldn't be a problem as they had the correct name on the booking, but a mistake had been made by expedia when passing my information through online and that I should ring them to get it corrected so my e ticket would then show my correct name. So again rang through to customer services at expedia who didn't really understand what I was trying to say and said they wouldn't be able to ring Ba as it was closed to which I said I had already spoken to Ba and I just wanted my name corrected. Who would have thought this would be so difficult as we are always being told to check all information is correct. I was also told from expedia that my name had been changed and a new e ticket sent through via email. On checking it wasn't an e ticket and who knows what has happened. So tomorrow I will start the whole process again of trying to get my name corrected. I also queried that on the e ticket that came through that although we are travelling on a BA schedule flight no baggage has been included. We were not made aware of this when booking so have now incurred an extra cost. We are very experienced in booking online and travel often and even commented at the time that we wouldn't need all the allowance. When I asked the customer service whether it was a schedule or charter flight we were on I was told it was a Boeing plane.! I still have 6 days before my flight so hopefully someone will be able to get this rectified judging on my experience so far I doubt it,"

Forced to cancel flight due to booking errors and appalling customer services
","I had booked a flight and hotel to Lusaka Zambia a few weeks ago through Expedia. The trip wasn?t for a holiday, but to deal with the tragic death of my nephew who was killed in a car crash.I was supposed to fly out yesterday evening to Lusaka with Emirates, but instead I was forced to cancel the flight because of an error made on booking and a result of appalling customer services practices. On Sunday (2 days ago) I realised that my e-ticket didn?t have my surname on it, only first and middle names. I called Expedia customer services immediately and told them the problem. I was told it would not be an issue, but was told to call on Monday morning because apparently Emirates Airline office was closed. I called on Monday morning and a gentleman at customer services noted the issue and went off to rectify it. When he came back after a long wait, he was talking to me, I could hear him and was talking back to him, but apparently he couldn?t hear me, so put the phone down. I called customer services again and another person started dealing with the issue, went off for a long time, came back, then cut the line off?phone went dead. I called customer services again and related the issue, and the gentleman could see the problem that on the name box on the online form there wasn?t enough room for first, 2 middle names and surname?.so it seemed my surname was omitted in the print out. Anyway, he went through a process to add the surname on the ticket, going away for a long spell and on his return stated that the surname amendment had been done. When I refreshed my screen I could now see my surname with my first and middle names all running together as one. He said this was all updated with Emirates?.so I was satisfied that all was well.Later in the day I tried to book my seat online through Emirates and kept getting message that that I didn?t have a booking. So I called Expedia customer services again, and a lady looked at the system and said all is well and that it takes time for the system to update for Emirates, but the booking was updated with my surname and asked if I received an email from Expedia showing the updated itinerary? I checked my emails and saw the new updated itinerary with my surname showing. I was assured that all was well, just turn up at airport and book seat from there. After this call, I was semi-satisfied but felt niggled within that something was wrong. I called up Emirates airline bookings and was told that they received the surname update, but because there was no e-ticket attached to it they cancelled the booking. They said all I have to do is go back to Expedia and get them to go through process again. I called Expedia and a gentleman dealt with my issue, going away for 20mins at a time coming back with different stories each time, saying he has sorted it out, then he would come back and say he has upgraded me from Tango class to uniform class, then he would go off again and return 30mins later?.by this time I was approaching 4pm, the time I needed to leave my house to go to the airport. The guy then finally came back and said it can?t be done and put me through to a lady supervisor who confirmed that my surname hasn?t been updated after all and that the only way I could go on this Emirates flight was to cancel my previous booking, paying an apparent ?200 cancellation fee, then re-book the same flight but the flights were more expensive at ?950. (My whole flight and 1 week 5-star hotel booking was previously ?1250, the flight being approx. ?548). I didn?t have the money to do that especially with the ?200 fine. I was devastated that suddenly it had all come to this and that I couldn?t go to comfort my family in their time of great loss and need. I was left with no flight and had to cancel my hotel booking as well. I am presently not able to book a flight and hotel with anyone else until Expedia have refunded my credit card, which they say can take up to 2/3 weeks. This is an appalling situation to be in!! I feel I was lied to several times in this whole experience- with incompetence and lack of morality in dealing with Expedia. Words cannot describe the experience and the frustration of not being able to go to Zambia as planned to comfort my family. It?s costing me loss of income because of having to have more time of work. There needs to be some sort accountability that companies such as Expedia are accountable to for their unjust dealings with customers."

The worst customer service i have ever experienced
","Expedia are the by far the worst company I have ever dealt with.Whilst booking a hotel on the Expedia website, the site bounced me back a page and unbeknown to me, changed the date of the booking.I emailed Expedia straight away and got an automated response saying that they would look into it. I also emailed the hotel and told them that the booking was a mistake and I would not be arriving on that day.The hotel emailed back immediately and told me that it was no problem and that they would not bill me.Expedia debited my credit card for the full amount and after a month they had still not replied to my complaint.I sent them another 2 emails and they told me they would prioritise my complaint and get back to me.

No Customer Service. Avoid Expedia.
","Due to fly out from Heathrow early in the morning I required a hotel room.On booking the hotel room I clicked the wrong date in error  (my flight date instead of the night before).I IMMEDIATELY realised my error and called Expedia to correct it. I waited on the phone for 30 minutes before an operator spoke with me. It was a very bad long distance line, but I explained my error. I was told he would call the hotel but that it was probably too late and the booking was non refundable. After another half hour wait he told me had spoken with the hotel and they would change the date and I would get a confirmation 24 hours before the date. When I got no confirmation from the hotel I called them to check and they said they was no record of any conversation with Expedia about my booking and it was not changed. There were now no rooms available on the day I required. I called Expedia to ask what had happened. This operator said he would talk to the hotel manager and try and rectify.  After a 45 minute wait, he said he had spoken to the Hotel Manager (he said he had pretended he was Expedia`s Manager ) and that a room was now booked for me but I would get a room servicing charge of 100GBP as the hotel was full - but that if I sent the receipt to Expedia, they would refund it to me. Six weeks later of course there has been no refund or acknowledgement to any of my numerous emails sent to Expedia.co.uk.or refund of the 100pounds chargedDo not trust or use this company - they lie to you."

Horrendous, heartless and ethically pallid TOOK UNAUTHORISED PAYMENTS
","Following a period of illness I decided to treat my little girl to a Disney trip for being so brave. I booked flights with Expedia on the phone and with their other company venere.com online for hotel. When the flight confirmation email came through I immediately called back to tell Expedia that the dates were wrong. They said this was my error not their's and to change to the dates I wanted would cost 1400 GBP on top of the cost of flights I'd bought. I phoned them five times at my own expense and after five hours twelve minutes on hold !!! They said there was nothing they could do. They took two unauthorised payments from my bank account. Venere said they could not change the hotel to match the flights so I had to write off hundreds of pounds paid to the hotel for being a no show also. Genuinely revolting way to treat someone. I enquired with Carrier KLM who said Expedia had lied when they said it would cost one thousand four hundred to change the flights, that I could have done it on their site myself for 284 but by then it was too late. My little girl was heartbroken, and I am very much out of pocket and heartily sickened by their psychological ploy of kettling customers by keeping them on hold until they agree to pay for a whole new ticket. Expedia are no better than muggers.Just to add that - I Did send all my itinerary details to the person who replied below. Don't believe their flannel  - there was no 'reach out' - radio silence. No-one ever contacted me back. Still heartily disgusted.In response to their invitation to email them I sent booking references and details again. Their reach-out is only lip service. No reply."

Despite receiving the confirmation email, I discovered just a few days before I was meant to fly out that Expedia had not correctly passed the booking onto the hotel!

I told them to place me into a hotel in the same or similar area of Ibiza. They confirmed the new hotel was, yet once the booking was made over the phone, I discovered it over an hours drive away from the town I wanted to stay. They provided with me ?150 credit to my account as compensation. When, some months later, I make a new booking with the intention to of using this credit, it goes immediately to taking the full cost off my card, without giving the option to deduct my credit.

I have emailed customer service and got a copy and paste email back that is not even relevant to my enquiry with 'insert customer name' still on it. Targets for replying to emails maybe? But useless response and you cant reply to those emails. Expedia have my money due to a fault on THEIR website's server. I have been lied to that they have tried to contact the hotel. The hotel don't even have my booking and I have still been charged twice. I am utterly disgusted with the service provided by Expedia and I will continue to make it known online and by phone until it is resolved. If hotel don't even have the bookings yet and Expedia have charged me twice (admitting it is their fault)- WHY DONT THEY JUST GIVE ME MY MONEY BACK??

This is an update to a previous 1 Star Review.
","My experience below happened, so I would still advise caution. However after posting this review on Trustpilot I was contacted by Stuart Newman at Expedia in London, and referred to their Priority Escalations Team in America. They efficiently looked into my complaint and issued a full refund.I hope that this is a sign that customer service is improving at Expedia. I will now consider them as an option again for future bookings.Previous Review...Booked a family trip with Expedia who confirmed in writing that the Hotel definitely had connecting rooms for our young children. Subsequently the Hotel came back to me saying they do not have any such thing. Expedia referred me to their customer services department in India (the same poorly trained staff who initially messed up the booking). There were no other suitable options so they have refunded the Hotel but refused to refund the flight leaving me ?1,200 out. They now won't respond to any communication from me - yes they actually hang up the phone on you and ignore your emails. Use Booking.com, Opodo or anyone else. This company sells holidays at any cost, just saying what you want to hear. They are ignorant, rude and don't deserve decent paying customers. Fortunately they soon won't have any looking at other similar reviews here."

Bad call centre experience and bad luck
","Last night I spent over 2 hours with 2 call operators who were based in Delhi, rearranging a flight to several days later to allow me to travel outside the incubation period for norovirus which has incapacitated the hospital in which I am currently on duty in the UK. After 2.5 hours with 2 operators and with me mainly on hold listening to music, I was told after advising of the same outbound itinerary 2 days later, having taken my credit card details and having advised penalties and extras in excess of ?230,  that the rescheduled flights could not be booked due to a system error message. This morning after the promised call-back failed to arrive I was told on phoning yet again that my flight was 'non changeable'. This flies in the face of the 'unforeseen circumstances' and the insurance sold via Expedia listing 'epidemics'(?definition)  as an exclusion, I am hugely disappointed in the 'non-changeable' aspect and the efficiency of the call centre! I will be left out of pocket, out of luck and out of a holiday for behaving responsibly in good faith and the public good.Addendum:- Many thanks to Stuart Newman and the Customer Relations team in promptly contacting me regarding the content of myposting and their good will gesture. I have read a number of postings of negative experiences with the call centre in India, and I have shared my experience in my account above. My opinion is that the quality of the customer experience with the call centre should be improved, with less waiting time on calls, and call backs delivered punctually when promised.I feel that this would be very beneficial for Expedia. In contrast I found the service and quality of contact with Expedia Customer Relations to be exemplary and I am not sure why these standards cannot be adopted by the call centre."

THEY TOOK MONEY FOR ADDITIONAL FLIGHTS I DIDNT BOOK

I HAVE COMPLAINED AND EVEN THOUGH EXPEDIA HAVE ADMITTED THEY WERE AT FAULT AND THAT MY MONEY WILL BE REFUNDED, I AM STILL TRYING TO GET MY MONEY BACK.  THIS WHOLE THING HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR 8 MONTHS NOW.  IT IS EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING!!!!!   NO ONE REPLIES TO MY EMAILS, AND WHEN I CALL THERE IS NO ONE THAT WILL ACTUALLY DEAL WITH MY PROBLEM AND MAKE THE REFUND.I WILL NEVER EVER BOOK WITH THEM AGAIN AND HAVE TOLD ALL MY FRIENDS TO AVOID THEM.I AM NOT GIVING UP AS THIS IS A LOT OF MONEY FOR ME AND IT WAS TAKEN WITHOUT MY CONSENT.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS
","I used to go to Expedia for every city break I took with my husband, but now I really would urge people to avoid them.  They are highly irresponsible in their dealings with their customers.  I booked a break to Paris in January, the advert included breakfast, which was a major reason for me selecting the hotel.  Once booked there was no mention of breakfast included.  I called Expedia who kept me on hold for approx 20 mins, but offered to reimburse breakfast if I scanned my receipts on return. I have since had to make several calls chasing them up, and have also sent emails, but am being completely ignored.  I have spent nearly an hour on the phone in total, and have been chasing just to get what they offered in the first place, and still to no avail.  I have no trust in them, and would quite frankly be pleased to see their market share dwindling and would not be surprised if they go out of business in the UK.  This is no way to treat your customers."

Botched booking and no resolution after a week: update
","Update: after contacting Stuart Newman, director for customer experience, we received a full refund very quickly. So situation resolved satisfactorily. Original review: We made a booking for a two night break. We went for a secret saver, promising a hotel with a pool and spa in the area we wanted to stay.  We understood the booking was non-refundable and we're happy with this. However, when the booking confirmation came through, we found the hotel did not have a spa and pool. We tried to cancel the booking but 7 days later have still not had resolution, despite several hours on hold on the customer service line. In fact, I think we have been lied to-promises to call back not followed through and we were also told that the Expedia agent had tried to contact the hotel about the reservation. However, when I spoke directly to the hotel, they told me there had been no inquiries from Expedia.I have no faith that this be resolved in a timely manner and we needed to make another booking. I've had to resort to disputing the payment with my card provider. Frankly, the very worst of customer service. Wise up Expedia."

botched booking
","I had a similar experience to S. Clarke: I was booking online (Vienna, hotel+flight) until I met a problem, and was persuaded to finish the booking by telephone. The price of the flight went up. The booking was sent to the wrong email address; I had to spend ages a few days later on the phone (after abortive emails) to trace it. When I came to add a suitcase for the hold, Easyjet had no trace of me. Expedia failed to address the problem; Easyjet dealt with it promptly.I have travelled with Expedia before, but am reluctant to do so again."

SHOCKING EXPERIENCE - AVOID!!!!!!
","Booked a trip to New York this afternoon with Expedia. Did the majority of the booking online via their website, but then hit a problem that could only be resolved by giving their Customer 'Service' Team a call and completing the booking through them. Complete disaster - the price increased twice during the telephone booking (even though three hours later it is the same price on their website!), their staff completely botched the seat reservations that I had placed and, to top it all, their staff claimed that my airline booking code is NOSYNC (Not Synchronised!). Called their Customer 'Service' Team (based in India) back to resolve issues, but they were useless - it took me 40 minutes (on top of the earlier 60 minutes) to get through and then experienced a series of lies and a 'couldn't care less' attitude.I've booked online with Expedia for several overseas trips over the past decade - on this experience I am likely to choose a different travel company in the future!

Only then once he hanged up I got an email that I will be charged for that one night more than TWICE the amount I was originally set to pay for three nights!When I tried to call back to figure out what went on the guy said he can't do anything and then forwarded me to a manager who then pretended the line wasn't working and hanged up on me!I then got an email from the hotel begging me to fix this with Expedia or they will have to charge me the original amount PLUS the new amount for the ""new reservation"" even though I never asked for a new reservation, I asked to change an existing one!So now I'm on the phone to the debit card company to cancel my card before Expedia can steal this money from me.I was a loyal customer of Expedia.com for years, but one attempt with Expedia.co.uk showed they simply have the worst customer service ever, and even worse managers.I am done with this company and I will check to see if I can sue them too."

Oh how I wish I had read the reviews first!
","Recently booked a package holiday through Expedia. Website stated standard luggage allowances applied which on checking BA's website, we found to be 23kgs per checked in bag, great! On checking Manage My Flight with BA after confirmation of our booking, we found we had been allocated cabin luggage only. We picked this particular package as the luggage allocation suited us because we like an active holiday and it was standard and at no extra cost........or so we thought!We tried to phone Expedia to query this but it took them 20minutes to answer AND We were then put on hold.....and left on hold.......for half an hour, before we gave up and put the phone down! We have tried several times since to call Expedia Customer Services but have been unable to gain an answer in less than 15 minutes  which is wholly unacceptable!We have emailed them, with no response. We now find that exactly the same holiday......flights, hotel, cost etc is advertised by BA themselves WITH the 23kgs of baggage included as standard! It will cost us ?140 extra to take two hold bags, which Expedia advertised as standard allowance!Should we not get a swift and satisfactory  result, I.e.......the baggage allowance advertised.....we would have to consider Watchdog or other media avenue!Additionally we would also consider cancelling and claiming a full refund as the holiday is not as described!Itinerary #18009191229"

Avoid: Sold Us the Wrong Tickets; Won't Address Through Complaints
","We booked flights around New Year 2015 to return from Germany. After some careful shopping around we decided to book our tickets through Expedia as it saved us I think ~?10 for two one way flights. We double and triple checked our flights to ensure we could carry one suitcase with us and were assured that all the tickets Expedia sold for British Airways included a baggage allowance. Imagine our shock on arriving at Munich Airport to find out that we had been sold a specialized ticket which does not have ANY baggage allowance. No mention of this anywhere on the Expedia itinerary and forcing us to pay ?80 on the spot. Expedia won't even handle our complaint now and are ignoring all correspondence. We were assured an 'escalation team' was handling our complaint over 3 weeks ago but clearly they just want to fob their customers off in the hope that they will decide it is more trouble than it is worth to complain.AVOID THIS COMPANY, pay the extra if you need to or just book the flights directly with whoever they are linking. Often it will be cheaper. The convenience of booking through them is NOT worth the hassle when something, invariably, goes wrong."

Spitting feathers. Appalling service.
",Seriously unimpressed. Booked flights to Norway through Expedia. Got an email a few days later saying flights not booked properly (Expedia fault). Flights then rebooked by Expedia - but the cost has nearly doubled - additional cost of ?320.60 to book exactly the same flights. Expedia promised that if I paid the full amount for the flights they would refund the difference to me within '5-7 days'. This confirmed in writing. That was on the 13th Jan. On Jan 29th I emailed again to say no refund had been received. Got an automated response saying someone would be back to me in 24 hours. Guess what????? a week later and ive heard NOTHING. And there's STILL no refund into my bank. Seriously disappointed and demanding an answer!

Lies lies and more lies
","Hi All Further to my post and after numerous calls to Expedia - there support staff confirmed that they have no control over ticket class and are just given what the airline provides..I communicated this with Emirates - who I must add - are an outstanding airline and do there best to help - confirmed that this is out of their control they effectively book exactly what Expedia or any other travel agent tells them.So in a nutshell - without any consent, approval or any form of communication Expedia book class of tickets to their own devices. What this means is that they will intentionally book a ticket class that we, as customers, are not allowed to upgrade, without any additional surcharges. I suspect this is how they make a little more money! May not be the case - but to the life of me I cannot understand why these cretins won't tell you what they are booking.I accept  - cancellations - have certain charges? But for goodness sake.. Upgrades??  Where you should be entitled to is predetermined by Expedia'a call handlers.Poor service - keep away! & outsourced to India have little communication. They lie & they cheat you out of your hard earned cash. We Look forward to booking trip without any hassle - & Expedia, with their poor management, are opposite of the ethos of booking a peaceful trip. I sympathise with some of your feedback!

Beware of overcharging
","I booked a family holiday to Dubai for 4 for my mum's 70th birthday, however when I checked my credit card statement Expedia had taken ?76 more than the amount quoted on their website and on my email booking confirmation. When I called them the person I spoke to agreed and went to speak to his supervisor and came back and said this was because I booked as a guest and didn't log onto my account. They said that they will look into this matter and see what the price was at time of booking. I have a photo of the screen as proof at time of booking which also shows the amount I should have been charged along with date and time, hopefully this will be proof enough. I am not happy about this I always book my holidays as a guest and have always paid price quoted in booking. I personally think this is an error as the amount I should have paid was ?3312.23 and the amount charged was ?3388.23 (one digit difference) but will wait to see what happens. I think it is disgusting that they used guest log in as excuse the price should be the same whether you are guest or member, and as I put my email address for confirmation this should recognise you as a member. I always book my holidays with Expedia, but will now go to Trailfinders who offered a similar price but included transfers and breakfast."

From bad to worse
","I have booked my flight to go back home and I was looking forward to see my family. After receiving a confirmation of my booking and several promotional emails with regards car hire, hotel etc. I would have never imagined to go to the airport to find out that my booking was never processed. No one if the customer service bothered to be in touch and let me know that there seemed to have been payment issues, but I received confirmation so I thought it was all good. At the airport I called the customer service and after almost 2 hours on the phone I was told to buy a new tickets and the money would have been refunded. Unfortunately it was too late, there were no more flights for the day and I had to wait the day after to depart. Back to London I had to call back the customer service at least 5 times before a miserable refund was done and a little compensation of ?20 was only done because I constantly rejected their offer of a voucher for using their website again. I appreciate that this technical issues can happen but the poor support of customer service made it from bad ti worse. I would never book with Expedia again and I honestly would not recommend it to anyone. Trust me, the few pounds you save are not worthy all the inconvenience they are able to cause without even a compensation!"

Inefficient
","Itin : 15100 814 869I regularly book flights on Expedia but this is the first time I have had to seek a refund, for cancelling my Mother's return journey on Emirates.Ten weeks ago I informed Expedia and  was informed money will be refunded on the credit card in a few weeks. Several weeks later and 6 telephone calls and 6 hours of my time, l am still waiting. for a refund of 172 pounds. They sent me an email a  few days ago that they were giving me a refund of  8 pounds and 30p . Today , after talking to 3 different members of staff , l have been promised that the refund of 172 pounds will be paid in the next 24 hours. No explanation about why they concluded  8+ pounds earlier - which incidentally  never went onto my cards.I would like to believe what they are telling me, but somehow  am not convinced that they will honour their word.This present experience has left us frustrated.  Over the weeks  I have spoken to Rudi, Ayesha, Aditiya to name just a few and been put on hold today for up to 27 minutes. Although staff are polite, they repeat the same story - refund matter will the excalation Dept. Each staff confirms that they will send an email to ask the dept to process the matter quickly . When l ask to speak to the Supervisor, l am told they are busy on other calls. Obviously they have never heard of phoning the customer back. Would be grateful if someone  who believes in providing a good service could look into this and resolve it once and for all."

Expedia customer service is appalling
","I booked 2 flights on 2nd Jan 15 for travel on 9th feb. (Booking FV8D0F). The website locked me out so I called.  A lady called Isha took the booking. I spelt the names to her. She phonetically read back, but as I don't know the phonetic alphabet and her accent I expected she had spelt them right. She has Mia spelt my husband's middle name. I called the same day! And have called so many times since. I have been promised called back from Debb, Jatin, Isha, and someone I could not pronounce. Never happened. Once only, did someone call me back who said the booking ""should be alright"".  I was also told on the phone that I should go to Virgin and pay to have it changed.   I have emailed Expedia and they say they have played transcript and it was correct. It is not!  In desperation I went to Virgin who were sympathetic and surprised at my treatment, but cannot help me as I did not book directly with them. I have sent emails, calls (why say they will call back and never do?). Could someone please contact me. Look at how many times I have called. Speak to me and help me. I am anxious and so worried my husband will not be allowed on the plane!"

Misfiring website, erroneous penalty charges and frustrating call centre
","I recently used Expedia to book a hotel. The root cause of my grievances can be attributed to the website which was experiencing technical problems due to a live price change around the time of processing my booking (a repeat problem with expedia after reading the reviews below). After multiple failed attempts I finally received a confirmation message & email for a successful booking.When checking into the hotel the receptionist stated there were 3 reservations under my name (instead of one). I was initially bemused by this before recalling the technical difficulties I experienced with the Expedia website. I explained the situation to the receptionist who provided reassurance there was nothing to worry about and charged me for one reservation (at a different cost to that detailed on the Expedia confirmation email).3 weeks later I noticed 2x ?52 'No show charge Travelodge' transactions on my bank statement. I phoned the Expedia call centre that evening to arrange my ?104 refund and was placed in a queue for approx 20 mins. When an agent finally answered, the line was so bad he terminated the call (I presume a long distance line to an overseas call centre).I called again later that night and spoke to an agent who reassured me morning shift will call back with an update. It is now 24 hours later and I have had no call back.Extremely poor sequence of events - I just want my money returned ASAP. Will not use Expedia again."

one star wish i could pick no stars
","Desperate for someone to help me with this, as I have waited in days for call backs after having my problem escalated. No one ever calls back and the call centre just say they need the supervisor.I have booked two packages one for me and my son, and one for my parents from different airports and to meet at the destination. A big spend !A chose half board option as it was available and is easy for my elderly parents. I tried this booking again and again each time clearly pressing half board then choosing my flight options, at the end when it came to pay 'half board' no longer showed up only hotel 7 nights. Twice I phone expedia before booking to make sure this was ok, I was assured both times if I picked half board that's what I would get and it did not necessarily show up on the invoice. I paid for both holidays.However just to be sure I contacted the Hilton hotel direct who say NO half board. After many unsuccessful attempts with expedia to get anyone to look seriously at this, I did get a lady who accepted there is a problem with the system and she neither could make the booking although choosing half board and doing everything correctly. The system was still showing the same deal I booked at that time.She escalated it E8704126, and said expedia needed to investigate how this error with THEIR booking occurred. The supervisor at the time suggested I paid all the half board supplements at the time of checking and sent expedia the bill to claim back. It will be around ?700, you must be joking !!!. With me rejecting this terrible idea I am told I have to wait for the investigation. However now no one will contact me. I booked Half Board and checked twice it would be included. I would not have made the booking was this not included and I expect it to be paid for at no expense to me before I arrive. If anyone higher in expedia reads this, I have everything logged and screen dumps of everything I booked, the girl on the phone admitted a system error, not my error. I have all this information ready to send to radio 4's you and yours program, consumer affairs. PS I am a very big spender with expedia which my account with you will show you. This will be last booking if this is not resolved !!!UPDATE following the priority escalation after writing this it was all solved in two days, with expedia paying the half board and admitting error. Hope this narrative helps someone else."

Serious Flaws in Booking Process - NOW JUST IGNORING ME!!!
","Unbelievably, in spite of many reminders and a request to clarify an email sent to me last night, there has been no response from Expedia. Here is a snippet from their website regarding their service - REALLY!""We promise you the best serviceWe want you to have the best possible experience before, during and after you book your holiday with Expedia ? so from the moment you come to Expedia.co.uk we?ll be there to support you and to ensure you travel with confidence.If you need any help booking, have a general travel question, or get stuck when abroad visit our Customer Support Centre or call 0871 226 0808.""  - and then wait for ages for someone to take your call!!!!""This is a brand new complaint and has nothing to do with the one posted last January. I hit the wrong button when posting the review - therefore ignore the ""Reply from Expedia"" as this refers to a completely different issue from over a year ago!""To cut a long story short, I have had a shocking experience trying to book a holiday on Expedia, resulting in over ?8,500 being taken from my bank account in error.I spent ages online last night trying to book, only for a series of messages regarding ""supposedly"" failed pay transactions stating either: ""SorryWe're unable to complete your booking at this time.?	Please wait a few moments, then choose ""Complete Booking"" again.?	If you're still having problems, please try your search again.orThere's a problem with your card.?	Please check the 3- or 4-digit card identification number.?	If that doesn't work, please try a different card.""I only discovered that payment had been taken when, being unable to book the holiday with Expedia, I tried booking the same holiday with another company, but the payment was rejected. I subsequently contacted my bank to be told that, although according to my online statement, I should have plenty of funds, there were 4 equal payments of over ?2,100 which were showing from the previous evening meaning that my limit had been exceeded.Since then I spent well in excess of an hour - on hold or talking with the Expedia call centre - to be advised that the funds will be returned to my bank within ""72 hours""!!! In the meantime, any other payments from my bank are likely to be rejected together with any other issues this may cause with the bank itself for going over the agreed limit!! The call centre dealt with this issue as best as they could but it should not be up to them to try to deal with such serious criticisms of Expedia's systems and in spite of my requests they were unable to put me through to anyone senior.Looking at Trustpilot reviews -  this is far from an isolated case and is in my opinion an extremely serious flaw in the booking process causing a huge amount of frustration and distress.A great deal of my personal and work time has been taken up with what should have been a very simple process of booking a family holiday and even more important, I am unable to access funds from my bank for up to 72 hours. As a consequence, due to lack of funds in the bank, we cannot book the holiday yet and no doubt, by the time that the funds are replaced  in our account, it will either no longer be available or the price will have gone up in the meantime !!!!!!"

Obviously I'm extremely excited to be going on my trip ! However I was left a little surprised and shocked when checking my credit card statement to find that I had actually been charged ?2425.04 !! I doubled checked my confirmation email I had received from Expedia and as I expected it was for ?2345.04 so why have I been overcharged !! I have called Expedia 4 times now emailed them sent screenshots of everything and told you will get a response in 48-72hrs ! I was reassured that it had been eacalted to the escalations department !! Well today we are a week on and not a single response ! But I have to wait 20mins again this morning to get through to Expedia only to be told oh can you send through everything again !! To a different email address !! This is ridiculous !! I just want a response and refund !!

Customer Service
","We booked a hotel (which another agent did for ?27 a night cheaper with breakfast)  and two flights to Dubai, initially we were only planning to book the hotel, but then decided to book the flights with Expedia even though it would cost about ?70 more (in total just for the flights). Thinking they are reliable and trustworthy, and not worth the risk of booking with other unknown on-line agents, we proceed with Expedia.After we booked our hotel and then flights, I noticed in the flights itinerary section for an offer to save money if we booked a hotel too (this did not appear in the hotel section for flights). So I thought I would check how much they would do the hotel for, which worked out to be about ?135 cheaper.Thinking we could call them up and maybe they could apply the offer, but were we wrong. The call centre didn't want to know, constantly raising their voice, shooting down anything we said and didn't care whether we didn?t book with them again (we asked the question). We decided to escalate by writing to their complaints department and then Stuart Newman, another pointless exercise, no response and no acknowledgement.In the past two years we have booked four hotels and two flights with Expedia, let?s just say I won?t be booking with Expedia again, even if I have to pay more money to another agent.To anyone wishing to book a ""great deal holiday"", frankly don?t expect any customer service if anything goes wrong, for that reason book with anyone else.Update:19/01/2015 ? After further communications with Stuart, we have been able to resolve our issues with Expedia and feel some what confidant in their service again."

Beware of card details required to reserve hotel with Expedia!
","In early 2014,I booked 7 nights accommodation for March 2014 at Falesia Hotel in Portugal through Expedia on a non refundable basis. I gave my card details on line to reserve the room but paid on arrival direct to the hotel. This was exactly as described on Expedia website. We had a great stay and decided to do the same this year.In November last year, I made a similar booking for this March again with Expedia. Again,the booking was on a non refundable basis and again I was asked to input my credit card details just to secure the reservation. The website page assured me that no payment would be taken but the details were just to secure the booking and final payment would be made at the hotel.Despite this assurance, full payment was taken from my card the same day as the bookingand I was charged a fee for using a credit card. Had I known I would be charged away, I would either have paid by debit card or indeed not booked at all.When I found through my credit card bill that payment had been taken, I contacted  Expedia (Delhi) straight away. The only answer I got was that the room has been booked on non refundable basis, and this I am not disputing. The problem was escalated and I got an email saying the same thing. I asked the call centre to try booking a room as I had and pointed out that web page still said pay nothing now, card details just needed to make reservation. Response was totally unhelpful. Various emails have gone back and forth, the last one was from Expedia saying they are escalating matter again and would reply, that was on 31st December 2014 and to date I've heard nothing.I'm aware that by booking on this basis I would always have had to  the full amount due, but the timing of payment was awkward and charging additional credit card fee was unexpected.  Call centre was useless and clearly unable to understand my complaint.23 Jan 2015I received an email from Expedia the same day as I put my complaint on Trustpilot saying they were making further investigations into the situation and asking for my patience whilst they did so. Seven days later still no reply."

","Booked a hotel via hotels.com, only after being contact by the hotel did I realise that this was a honeymoon special offer. Tried to get someone to own the issue, dealing with Expedia or hotels.com over 10 promises to sort this out.Big issue is that when booking on a tablet you can't see these details confirming that it's a special offer, so you have no clue. I have hightlighted this to them but no response i can only assume they don't care.I now have no hotel for a vist in a few weeks, every hotel is now multiple ?1,000s more expensive than when I originally booked. Looks like we will sleeping on the street with our 6 year old. We have more chance of getting divorced and remarried than anyone sorting this out.What an absolute disgrace?"

No attempt to be great at customer service
","Seriously regret booking with Expedia. ?6k and about 3 hours of hold time later, I am still waiting for a call back and want to cancel my holiday cost-free or get a partial refund...The short story is that I was advised by an agent on their chat facility that certain costs were included in the package that turned out not to be - leaving me to find 500 euros extra on what is already an expensive holiday. When I disputed this, it was supposed to be investigated by an uncontactable 'escalation team' and I was to be called back. I wasn't. So I called again. And was told I would be called back. I wasn't. So I called again. Same story. And same story again. And I'm still waiting. The last call, with the 'floor manager' for the Indian call centre left me reeling - he was shouting at me down the phone that I couldn't possibly expect any business to trust me, without absolute proof, that a customer service agent had misinformed me. He wouldn't give me anyone else to speak to. I attempted to point out that many businesses indeed to trust their customers, because they recognise that good customer experiences drive their brand, recommendation and long term growth. But I was shouted down.Really do not use them, as others have said, the hassle isn't worth it no matter how much cheaper they purport to be."

Disappointed, Disillusioned, Disgusted and Damn Angry
","I started off searching for a two week holiday for myself and my husband 11/1/15 and found the perfect hotel through Expedia. Began the online booking which appeared simple enough to follow until I got to the payment. I didn't want to pay in full and wanted to place a deposit so was reluctant to put card details. Saw the ""need help with booking "" and rang the number....in Delhi. The agent there made the booking on my behalf and then told me the price had gone up since our conversation began. Ok, wasn't much so said ok. Got confirmation email that deposit had been taken. This morning, 12/1/1, on reviewing the confirmation I noted that it stated no breakfast included where it had clearly stated it had been on the website and neither did it indicate any transfers to and from airport/hotel - which the agent had never mentioned in conversation. I rang the number again...Delhi...to be told that they assured me there was breakfast included. I asked for an email confirmation since their word at the end of the line was not sufficient. I was placed on hold until the gentleman confirmed an email had been sent to me confirming that. As an afterthought I asked did the price include transfers to which I was told no and that he would transfer me to someone else who would give me a price for this....holding again on the phone. Sonia came on the phone very matter of fact and gave me a price of ?250 !!!! WHAT? I told her no thanks I was already paying enough and I would look at cancelling. Went back to booking confirmation email regarding cancellation where it referred to terms, clicked on the link and opened into an Expedia site that said NO BOOKING FOUND. Cautious and angry as I was now with the shambles of the service so far I could not access the terms regarding cancellation. Rang Delhi again. Got the ""lovely"" Sonia again and explained this. She told me I had a booking. Told her from here it was saying not which was just as well because I wanted to cancel. She then told me I couldn't cancel until I had paid the full amount, due inApril!!! I said how could I know this because I don't have a booking and can't access the terms! .....on hold again!!! When she came back she said there must be a glitch in the system and the reason why it was showing no booking was due to the Delhi agent who had done my booking....AN EXPeDIA error?? She talked me through how to access my itinerary, which I did and the details shown there stated IN A BIG YELLOW BUTTON.....BOOK NOW! Good, I thought.....it hasn't been booked but she told me it had and that was that and there was nothing I could do further to cancel until I paid the entire sum.  Asked to speak to someone else and she said that they would just tell me the same. I ended the conversation by thanking her for nothing and that I would never ever use Expedia again.Above the yellow button there was a small drop down menu which said cancel this trip search....so I did.My deposit has not been taken, although for some reason just now Expedia has taken ?54.64???I still cannot access my itinerary details to see the regulations regarding cancellation.I WANT TO CANCEL IMMEDIATELY. I am so disappointed and upset by the lack of customer service, information, the candid approach by your agents and instead of feeling joyous about my holiday am dreading the Expedia experience yet to come....whether there is a booking or not.Stuart Newman....please help me resolve this.  I feel like informing every communication site possible and warning other potential Expedia users to avoid your site totally!I urgently await a response.Linda17/1/15...despite assurances from you Stuart, I have received a missed call from a member of your team informing me that she would send me an email requesting a convenient time to call. 1st request was for Wednesday 15th at a given time.....no call. I sent another email to Felisha saying I would be available today at a given time....no call. The full deposit has been removed from my account  - today- and yet I still cannot view my itinerary since it says I have no booking!! Do I have the confidence, in view of other unhappy posts I have since read, that Expedia has actually booked my hotel? No.  So far looks like just the flights!! I am taking the opportunity of telling everyone I know NEVER TO USE Expedia. I will be looking at taking this to those I don't know and will consider taking this to a much wider audience if my concerns are not resolved within 7 days.20/1/15  -  with huge thanks to Stuart, my concerns have been resolved.  I finally had to telephone India to confirm that the booking and everything with it had been officially cancelled since as of 12.00 noon today, other than the communication with you, no explanatory email had been sent other than a brief note stating that ?X amount had been refunded to my card account, nothing else.  With this in mind I took it upon myself to telephone India this morning to confirm that there are no hidden surprises and that the booking had indeed been cancelled, to which it had.  A couple of hours ago I received a telephone call from one of the Expedia team informing me that payment would be returned and should take 7 days to hit my account....I informed her she was a little late and that this had already reached my account the day before, but thanked her anyway for the unnecessary call.I thought I would share this  -  the meaning of Expedite is to make (an action or process) happen sooner or be accomplished more quickly  -synonyms: speed up, accelerate, hurry, hasten, step up, quicken, precipitate, rush.  Maybe, just a suggestion, that this could be the mission statement for EXPEDIA and used in all customer service training.Once again, thank you Stuart.Linda24/4/15 ANGRY IS TOO POLITE A WORD!Despite all assurances and my refund as identified in my previous comments, I have today received an email informing me that ?888.06 has been deducted from my account for a holiday that has been cancelled. Stuart Newman...I would like to hear what excuse can be given for this now and a total and immediate refund of this money back into my account. This will go viral, trust me, if this is not immediately resolved. You had given me false faith.I await your immediate response.An extremely angry Linda!"

Mis sold and misleading advertisement of hotel room
","I have just had a horrible experience booking a trip on expedia's website. Searched on their website for a 3 person trip to amsterdam and all 3 people to share one room. The search brought up a number of hotels. Picked one as it had good reviews and was a decent price. The next screen asked me to pick a room, the only one available was a superior room which stated 1 queen bed. As I have stayed in many hotels in the past I thought they would provide an extra bed free of charge or a pull out bed or sofa bed at the very least. However, when I completed the booking I realised the confirmation email stated that an extra bed would incur a 45 euro extra charge per night! I went back to the search engine again and this information was hidden behind a fees tab. This information should have been provided up front and the 45 euro should've been added to the original price. Do they really expect 3 people to share a queen bed? Therefore I have been mislead by expedia thought the booking process. 3 people cannot sleep in the room for the price quoted.I have also contacted expedia about this and their response has been frankly condescending and they did not seem as though they had read my complaint. Thoroughly disappointed with expedia, a company that I have used many times in the past both in my leisure and with my company. I will be taking my money elsewhere in the future unless this gets resolved adequately."

Expedia -- is this a scam?
","I was booking 2  flights to JFK on Expedia website and got as far as entering details. Then the page froze before I got to the payment page. So I called. The assistant said that often happened and he would complete the booking. Suddenly the price had risen by ?18. Not a cc fee, just the fare had apparently gone up. It has been the same for 2 days so I smelled a rat. I said I would ring off and try the site again and he was keen for me to do that while he held the phone call with me. I refused, rang off, logged off my account, opened a different browser and started again as ""Guest"". Bingo -- the original price came up and I booked OK this time. What is this all about? It seems like a total scam to me. I did ask if the price is higher just because it is a phone booking but he denied that too. Just the fare had risen. Not so!"

Well done Mr Newman for getting involved! Resolution after 1,222 mins.
","After my 19 year old nephew (travelling home alone after a year at university) was kicked off his ?700 flight in 17 June 2014 for no reason having bought and paid for his ticket in November 2013 and having arrived more than 4 hrs prior to the flight. He was left overnight for 12hrs in the airport with no help, accommodation or refreshment, and had to buy another ticket for the next day for ?800.  After 6 weeks of emails and phone calls, we finally got a refund on 25 July for 1 ticket. After 6 further months of complaining and getting no-where via the Expedia recommended channels, we complained directly to Mr Newman, Expedia Director of Customer Experience via the TrustPilot Website on 1 Jan 2015. Mr Newman replied on 5 Jan, and passed it on the UK office, who made a rather derogatory offer of a ?100 Expedia voucher (which we obviously declined - my nephew says he will never travel with Expedia again). Finally after more emails (to Mr Newman), the UK Priority Office (based in Las Vegas, US), made a less derogatory offer of ?200 refunded to the original purchasing creditcard account. This barely covers what Expedia should have paid out on the night - ?100 accommodation, ?40 dinner, breakfast, drinks, ?60 excess baggage charge as the new flight  (Air France) had less of a baggage allowance than the original flight (Etihad), so my nephew had to stand in the airport and sort which belongings he would leave in the bin!! This excludes the 40 emails, 18 telephone calls, and total of more than (just what I could be bothered to add up) 1,222 mins or more than 20 hours that I have spent on this, which includes 367 minutes or 6 hours 7 minutes that I have spent on the phone. Anyway this was supposed to be a review to acknowledge the intervention of Mr Newman. Thank you Mr Newman. And my review of 1 Jan 2015 which awarded Expedia 1 star has increased very slightly to 2 stars. Dr Michael Heng. PS Expedia still does not know why my nephew's ticket was refused. Something about Expedia buying the ticket through Hahn Air? Well the ticket was Manchester to Mauritius with Etihad and Air Seychelles so why Hahn Air? Nobody at Expedia has been able to explain this. The final explanation from Expedia was about there being a systematic error which caused a delay in the ticket being issued... well he bought his ticket 7 months in advance..."

No refunds! Beware!
","I booked a return flight to Zurick, via Expedia, for business. I was flying there and back in a day. Not a cheap flight at all, c?400. Of the various Expedia options presented I chose BA.My arrangements changed and I called Expedia 3 days before my flight to cancel and was told by their agent that there were no refunds on it. That was very fundamental information and at no time was it mentioned during booking. The Expedia agent referred me to their 'terms and conditiions', which frankly was just insulting. They need to make 'no refunds' policies very clear, in all ways, before booking. Disgraceful."

Charged for non-existing flight & terrible customer service
","More than 3 months ago I booked a flight on their website expedia.mx and as I realised I made a mistake selecting the dates I called them right away to amend this. The  customer service agent said that as the booking has only just been made it was ""better""  to just cancel it and book a new one. I asked him for specific proof that if I agree to book a new flight I would get a full re-fund and he pointed out that my itinerary was already cancelled and I could check this online in my expedia account. I was able to confirm that the flight was cancelled and there was also a message which said I was going to get a full refund from them.After several long calls my case was escalated to tier 3 to whom I sent my bank statement as they requested. Tier 3 replied that as they voided the first flight ticket I was never charged despite that my bank statement is clearly showing the charge. So therefore they are refusing to refund me a flight of nearly ?900 which is really annoying. Plus tier 3 wont even take my calls or reply to my emails any more. I have now started to deal with my banks disputes department who have told me that this case needs to be dealt with before mid January or else I may not able to claim my money back. My advise is to never book through them!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------3 days after my last post on Jan 31,20014, here is un update:#Expedia I've sent flight confirmation email and flight cancelation email from expedia together with my bank statement to the email provided by Stuart (Director of Customer Experience) in his reply below. The charges in my UK credit card clearly match the charges from expedia and yet the tier 3 team from expedia.com says ""expedia didn't made the charge"".  I'm now told that I must have booked it through another travel agency or directly with the airline as if I was trying to steal from them. I'm shocked by the way they are treating me, it feels that not only they are ripping me off with nearly ?900 but I'm also being accused of trying to steal. I'm only a student and that's money I need to survive whilst studying. I can't understand how they are saying they didn't make the charge when their fare ticket in my booking matches the charge in my bank statement down to the penny.Not sure if the ""error"" was made initially by their system or their team in Mexico but what I do know is that my case was escalated to tier 3 which I believe is in America, -as they reply to me from expedia.com- and that they are refusing to refund my money.Incredibly disappointed, shocked and frustrated, thank you Expedia!"

Charged twice for some airline tickets I purchased with Exepdia
","March 2015. Final update:I have received my refunds after 4 months, after well over 40+ emails, & over 20+ Ph calls. This was achieved through the kind advise of a USA based legal advocate, which than opened a case with their escalation team.So everyone be warned, read reviews before booking, I have now booked several more flights & hotels all directly but NOT through expedia. Lesson well learnt & the hard way..Happy & safe travels.Update:This week marks the 6th week of waiting, dealing with Expedia through their resolutions manager. They have found the duplicate charge, acknowledged the duplicate transactions, but to date still no refund or indications of possible timeframe for resolution. Totally unacceptable, delay in organising refund.To date I have exchanged well over 20 emails and several ph calls with Expedia.Very, very annoyed.Be warned!!!!I am a frustrated customer of Expedia who has being charged twice for some airline tickets I purchased of them recently.(5.12.2014)I booked through their customer service ph line, all went well with 3x airline tickets charged to my AMEX Cr card. Within mins, I received a complete booking, e tickets from Expedia via email.On checking my internet banking several days later, I can see the amount once charged by Expedia and the same amount charged by the airline. I immediately called AMEX, they confirmed that both amounts have clearly being charged not as a hold.Than my calls to Expedia 12 in total to date, some resulting in well over 1 hr, 8 emails to no joy. I pointed out to them that I dealt with them & no point I dealt with the airline. Today is the 7th working day, still I have no received any confirmation from them, rather multiple case numbers confirming my case. I have provided to them a screen shot of the AMEX statement showing clearly how I have being charged twice, once by Expedia and the same amount by the Airline days apart. Since than, AMEX has now suspended and disputed the duplicate charge made by Expedia on my behalf, pending a reply from Expedia. To date Expedia has not being of any help, are refusing to accept that they have charged me twice, refusing to acknowledge that they are responsible for this error, whereby I only dealt with them and refusing to refund the duplicate charge. All they are doing is giving me case numbers and flogging me off. This has a caused a lot of wasted time in correspondence via emails, ph calls & a lot of stress, anxiety and inconvenienceVery, very poor customer service, be aware.Can some please help me!!!Thanking you in advance."

Great except for pop ups!
","I have used Expedia on a few occasions now. Its very good but there are there are two things I don't like about it. 1: I usually find most places are B&B as standard, and in the hotel description Expedia sees fit to cite 'Food and drink' in the same box as the free Wifi etc, so its not clear as to whether breakfast is included until you have booked and then you fimd it is not! Its very confusing!2: Has no one yet told Expedia how IRRITATING it is to be trying to book and have to shut down the ANNOYING pop ups telling us how many people are looking at this hotel right now, or the fact that someone has booked a room in the last hour..WE DONT CARE!!!!!IF Expedia don't stop this I for one will be switching to another booking agent!"

Book now, pay later? Not so much. - RESOLVED
","UPDATE: I posted a bad review (see below) regarding an unpleasant experience with an Expedia supplier hotel and their slow reaction to a refund request.I cc'd Mr. Newman into the email and received a reply from him the very next day.The issue has now been resolved, I was extremely satisfied with the care and swift response on Mr Newman's part. Although I am still slightly wary of the way some hotels have set up their book now, pay later offer where they take the money straight away without telling you (an issue that definitely needs to be addressed soon!), I will not hesitate to keep using Expedia for future bookings, if only for one Mr Newman.ORIGINAL POST:I have been waiting for a refund form Expedia and their supplier, Hotel Gheestelic Hof in Bruges, for 12 DAYS now.This is a refund that I technically should not be chasing AT ALL because I booked this hotel through a book now, pay later scheme, where I was assured by the Expedia.co.uk site that I will be paying ?0 at time of booking, and that the fee will be collected upon check-in at the hotel.Of course, I found out the day after that ?250 (roughly ?198) has been taken from my current account (my bank confirmed that Hotel Gheestelic Hof has first attempted to take ?750, then ?500, which both did not go through as the funds weren't in my current account at the time - and certainly they weren't because I wasn't prepared to be charged ANY amount at that time, as per their book now, pay later policy).Expedia's customer service have explained to me several times that this is due to the fact that a pre-authorised hold has been placed on my account, as if this should make a difference - it does not. Whether it was an automatic pre-authorised hold or not, the fact of the matter is these funds have been made unavailable from my current account when it certainly shouldn't have, when I wasn't aware at all that this can happen.If you advertise a book now pay later scheme on any website, and it is made explicitly clear that I am to pay ?0 until I check in, and then the funds are taken out of my account anyway, I find this extremely misleading - I hold both Hotel Gheestelic Hof and Expedia.co.uk responsible for this oversight.I also find it extremely dissatisfying that despite repeated calls to Expedia and even one call to the hotel itself, all I am told is that the manager is unavailable and that they will get back to me 'soon,' as if I haven't been waiting long enough for this to be resolved. As if, despite the fact that fund have been taken out of my account without my authorisation, or at the very least without my knowledge, I have no reason to be upset or demand a quick resolution to all this."

misleading booking process
","My husband & I have booked a trip to New York for January. We were originally going to book Virgin flights with Ebookers but during online booking were advised that seat allocation was not available. This prompted me to check Virgin & saw that they now charge ?25 pp each way so we considered alternative flights. When trying to book the next day, the hotel was not available.....which is how we came to Expedia. We chose  BA flights with a connection in London & during the booking process  we were able to launch the seat map for all 4 flights & choose our seats. There were cheaper flights available but we specifically made the choice to pay extra for BA as we could reserve our seats at no apparent extra charge. Later on checking our bookings with BA, none of the seats were reserved & to do so would cost an additional ?160. I called customer services (yes it is an indian call centre) & was not able to resolve this at all. I then sent a complaint email, recieving an automated response saying they aim to respond within 48 hrs. It has been 5 days & im still waiting!! My complaint is with the booking process which is misleading.  You are led to believe you are booking seats on the airline & we certainly made a choice to pay extra for a specific flight for this feature. I see many reviews on here about hidden charges & am now worried that we may also have extra charges at the hotel! This is the first time of using Expedia & looks like it will be the last. Yes it was easy to book...but customer service is non existent once they have your cash. In my complaint I tolsd them that a measure of a good company is how they respond to problems, because things do go wrong, & this is their chance to redeem themselves & restore our faith in perhaps using them again.

Warning to all - do not trust.  Very upset over Expedia - charged my card 4 times.
","I tried to book a holiday yesterday with them to fly out on the 21st December.  I put in my payment details only to get the message, sorry there is a problem with the system please try again in a few minutes.  Of course I did this and got the same message,  tried again and then phoned up expedia to ask why I couldn't book over the internet.  They said the price had gone up ?500 so I said I would look elsewhere but they said they would honour that price.  My card was then declined and the agent said he would hold the booking for me until I sorted my credit card out.  Phoned HSBC who told me they have taken the money 4 times which maxed out my card and it was now frozen.  Called Expedia straight back - (flight had now gone depsite the agent saying he would hold it for me) , who said they would sort it out straight away.  Tried to book another holiday this morning to find out my card had been declined so I went to straight to the bank to see if they could unlock it.  3 hours later, HSBC couldn't help and Expedia were now saying it would be 72 hours.  I am now waiting for them to call me (an hour late at time of writing) as I asked to speak to a manager as this was unacceptable behaviour and I was fed up of being passed to different agents, repeating everything again and not getting anyway. They also blammed my card saying it was at fault and not them.   I could only book the holiday last minute so now its looking like my family won't get a Christmas holiday now - thanks to the lousy service from expedia as I can't use my credit card so can't book another holiday.

","One star is too generous. I have used Expedia several times without a problem. However, when you need to speak with someone rather than deal by computer it becomes impossible.

Our intention was to pay individually at the hotel. 4 days later I was charged in full for all bookings.After several hours wasted on the phone speaking with most of their Indian call centre (all unhelpful), I was finally escalated to their 'priority' response team, who at least are polite.After 2 months and yet more time wasted apparently the hotel is unable to process a refund. The best they can offer is that Expedia refunds now and then recharges my card 3 days before travel (the booking is completely cancellable).2 weeks on and still waiting for the promised refund to hit my card..."

Immediately I called Expedia customer services to revoke the cancellation due to a human error, which Expedia should have provisions for. The only thing I asked the totally unsympathetic customer support lady was to go in my itinerary and cancel the cancellation. She basically told me that the Expedia policy is they don't care and there is noting anyone can do to just get in touch with the hotel and explain that the room has been paid for and its cancellation is void.

What a joke!
","We booked several flights through expedia for our honeymoon. We got a call one day asking for us to call them immediately as there was a change to our flight schedule. I called them and was told that the time of one of our connecting flights had been changed and we would no longer be able to make the connection. I asked them what my options were and was given the option of either leaving the next day, or getting another flight that day which would involve a layover somewhere. I told them I had to be in Toronto that day and would discuss the options with my husband and call them back the next day. I called back and said we would take the layover option. I was then informed that this was no longer an option. I was told that our options were now to take a connection either the day before or after...How am I supposed to make a connection on a Thursday if my flight doesn't arrive until Friday? When I asked the representative this question he agreed with me. I asked to have the original rep call me back as we had talked for quite some time.He called me back multiple times during the middle of the day. I'm a teacher so I obviously can't answer during class time. I was left a voicemail saying that the airline had a 'reward' for me and could I call back. I called back at a time that was convenient for me and was told that the 'reward' offered by the airline is that we would have to leave the next day. I asked if the airline would pay for us to stay in a hotel that night to which the response was no. I said to leave the flight as is and we would have to buy a new connection. I assumed that was the end of it.I then started getting calls about 1-2 weeks later saying there had been a change to the flight schedule and could I please call back ASAP. Again, these calls were made during the middle of the day so I obviously couldn't reply. When I finally did call back, I was told exactly the same thing - the connecting flight time had been changed and what did we want to do. I explained that I had already spoken to someone. I then asked if we cancelled, how much of a refund could we get. I was told we would get ?137 back. We paid over ?1300 so clearly this wasn't a option. Again, I informed them to just leave the flight as is as we had already booked a different connecting flight. I had expressed my discontent on various social media sites and received several tweets from Expedia saying they were looking into it. It's now been nearly a month and I finally got a call from customer service. What a joke that was! I still do not know the point of this call, except to point out that they had called multiple times and gotten my voicemail. Well, if you call during the day when most people are at work, what do you expect? The man I spoke to never actually got around to telling me the point of the call even though I asked him point blank. He wouldn't let me finish my sentences, kept cutting me off and eventually I hung up on him as I was getting nowhere. I don't even think he knew why he was calling! I have used Expedia many times and have always had good things to say. This has left a horrible taste in my mouth, and has put a real damper on my honeymoon. We've lost money and wasted time trying to sort it out. I can honestly say that I will NEVER use Expedia again. It's not worth it. The customer service has been shockingly appalling. I assumed it would be quite good considering they're such a prominent company but alas, that's not the case.My advice, don't use Expedia. EVER. For anything!"

Never ever use expedia.
","I booked a break on the 25th of September 2014 to stay at the sea breeze guest house in Ilfracombe Devon for a one night stay on the 27th of September. I used expedia and booked through venere. I received my booking through an email confirmation. I drove the 4 hour journey to the guest house I then showed the proprietors of the guest house my email confirmation from venere on my phone.I was then told sorry we have no booking for you, Infact we have been fully booked for weeks.The owners were very helpful and sorry for the situation we were in. They did say it had happened a couple weeks previously with somebody else but on that occasion they did have a spare room available. We weren't so lucky.They rang venere for us but all venere could say is that they would refund my credit card.The owners of sea breeze did contact another guest house that had a room available but unfortunately when we looked it wasn't suitable, so we ended up in an hotel after driving around for an hour and half trying to find somewhere to stay.When we returned home I emailed venere and told them I expected some compensation as well as our money back for a room they sold us that wasn't even available.  I got no response back from my email I rang venere endless times over a 3 and a half week period. I was fobbed off and lied to I was told I would get call backs I didn't. In the end I went into my bank I told them everything and showed them the proof and they agreed that I had waited long enough for a refund so they refunded my account. They said they would take it up for me because it was totally unacceptable. I would never ever use expedia again they are a total waste of time and frauds."

Underhand practices to gain an advantage!!!
",Take my advice & do not use this company. They use tactics to get your business like gaining an advantage on price comparison sites then you find out on arrival there are hidden charges. This happened to me recently whereby they left me financially embarrassed when checking out of a hotel. I wrote & complained after the trip & they did not acknowledge my complaint. When I queried it 6 weeks later they stated they had no knowledge of my email. When I persisted they stated they had & that my invoice clearly showed additional charges when I asked the call operator to explain to me where as we both viewed the same document he could not. I asked to speak to a Supervisor & he stated a supervisor had my number & would ring back within 30 minuted. 24 hours later guess what...... No call.... I am very well travelled & will NEVER use these people again. I believe they operate illegally in their practices.......

DO NOT USE THEIR APP!!
","I have used Expedia.com before and it had worked fine, HOWEVER, I tried booking a weekend trip, hotel + flight via their app and it has given us a complete headache! After all our details were put through, the app decided to tell us there was an ""error"" processing our transaction. We tried again and still the same message. Fair enough. We then decided to just use their website and that worked fine. What wasn't fine was the next day we realised Expedia had charged us for the app bookings too! We called them up multiple times to get a refund but they refuse to, saying their system didn't ""show"" that we had any errors whilst using the app and that we shouldve checked our emails when we made the app booking ?? Um no, why would I check my email if your app gave me an error message?? I trusted their app to provide the correct information. Big mistake. Whats more, their customer service team delivered anything but good service, rude and unhelpful, we kept going round in circles and were told (lied to) that the escalation complaints team would be in contact with us. They never did contact us the THREE times that they said they will. The battle rages on. Absolutely terrible!! Don't use expedia,  avoid the hassle !!"

No refund for no rooms at the Hotel Britannia Excelsior Como Italy.
","I sent a review for the Hotel Britannia Excelsior in Como Italy and also asked for a refund from Expedia. Our booking was for a guaranteed room with parking and a late arrival: Reference Number: 7461670 if anyone can help.We booked July to stay August 22nd. A guaranteed booking with parking & late arrival was great.I drove from straight from Calais on route to Tuscany to find on arrival in Como at 7pm no parking reserved (It is very hard to find a space at Lake Como, expensive & restricted with times) and no room. After taking our passports they told us they did not have a room for us. Following some minutes of arrogance and poor attitude from the reception, a man and an absolutely obnoxious Scottish woman (see other reviews), they said we can have a room at Hotel Lario at Mezzegra of the same standard. We were not happy with this but after being ignored for 20 minutes we went to have a look. Although marked as three star it certainly was not and completely different type of hotel. The place appeared empty as was the lounge and restaurant, completely different from the Britannia. If you look at the two hotels you can see the difference that they claimed were the same. We returned to the Britannia to complain again and asked them to find us a hotel of the same standard and was met with abuse and indifference and we actually stood there for another 20 mins thinking they were looking for us. When a guest spoke to us and they were told to 'ignore them they are just standing there'. Now maybe just hear say but other guests who saw our predicament and told us of poor facilities, poor condition rooms, and towels like tea cloths and of other guest that refused to stay there even on tour with a travel firm beginning with T. The whole customer service was appalling and not a very nice experience. So nothing for us to do but try to find a hotel late at night in August in Como, that was a challenge and took an hour and a number of miles. At 9:30 we did find another but it was difficult to find and more expensive. The look of the outside and location of the Britannia Excelsior is why we booked but the reception staff were an absolute shambles and ignorant. Reception staff should be replaced with people with customer service skills. Expedia should also make sure their suppliers keep to their booking agreements of contracted guarantees for bookings. Contacting us by email or phone would have been good as they knew days ahead and when asked they just said ?we did not have a telephone?! So what was to be a great anniversary trip started as holiday from hell?I have used Expedia before all the family have but maybe not again as you just don't know until you have a problem."

","I recently had an outstanding issue with EXPEDIA and was at a dead end, as it could not be resolved for a while. Then i chanced upon this website and i was surprised to see (name) (from Expedia) engaging with customers to find a solution to their issues. What caught my attention was his willingness to share his e-mail address which is a sign of a genuine person wanting to ensure customers issues are resolved. I mailed to him regarding my issue and true enough he responded to my e-mail and within 3 working days i have a solution to my issue. Prior to e-mailing [name] i had a very bad impression on Expedia, but after seeing his fast action, he has restored the confidence back. It is not a nice thing when a customer has an issue but [name] is willing to listen and identify solution for the customers which is rarely seen these days. Thumbs up to [name] and his team."

AVOID, miss sellers of tickets over baggage allowance.
","When I called and booked my flight I was told that if I booked over the phone I would only pay ?10 pounds each way for baggage, this made the Expedia option cheaper than booking with BA, so I went ahead and booked.Once I received my confirmation I tried to book online for my baggage but had not been given the right code to do so. I had to call twice to get a code that worked and then that would only let me book baggage at a rate of ?34 each way.I made a third call that day and after spending an hour on the phone was told that my case would be referered to the call listening team and was verbally informed that I would get a call back in 48 hours. I then subsequently received an email stating it would be 5-7 days.After 8 days I called again to be told that the listening team had not yet listened to the call, I spoke to another supervisor who informed me that it would be escalated and I would get a call back within 4 hours. This took a further 30 minutes on the phone.I called again the following day as I had not received a call back after the promised 4 hours and was informed that the team was looking at it and was again promised that I would be called back by 2pm that day.To date I have never received any call backs from Expedia. It has now been 2 weeks since I first lodged this issue with Expedia.  I have not received any emails with any explanations either.I have never known such poor service from an organisation. I question as to whether calls are monitored and this is just a stalling tactic hoping that once miss sold a ticket customers will just go away.Needless to say I will not be using Expedia again or recommending Expedia to anyone and would say 'AVOID'."

Misleading and Evasive

Hotel reduction from ?191 to ?99.It was a hotel I stay at regularly so looked suspicious - sure enough on the hotel's own website was only ?99 and has always been about this price. I felt it was misleading because gave the impression Expedia was saving the customer ?92 when actually saving ?0. I did further research to back this up and found the same over and over.Customer services had no interest in looking into this or rectifying the issue ie restoring customer confidence.I requested contact details of a more senior person 4 times but they were unwilling to provide this - why not Expedia?In fact I had 6 responses over a period of time but from 6 different people  so there was no continuity and felt fobbed off each time.RESPONSE to EXPEDIA'S RESPONSE...Well [name] - I sent you the information and you have DONE NOTHING in weeks despite chasing you several times.You are clearly out of your depth and I now understand why your 'Customer Experience' department is such a shambles.Reading the reviews, other customers have clearly had a similar experience."

Running an illegal operation in my opinion, DO NOT USE!!
","I booked a holiday for my wife and I to RSA for December back in February. Paid in full, confirmed and all set to go. In July I received an email saying I must accept the changes to my flight or request a call back. There was a 2 day difference in the connecting flight and not acceptable so I requested a call back. No-one called. I eventually had a response from emails after a week. Explained that the dates couldn't change due to connecting flights in RSA. After a long and tedious conversation, Expedia could do nothing but cancel my flights and give me a refund. This is the kicker!! Although I entered into an agreement with Expedia and paid monies directly to them, they are not obligated to refund me I have to get it from the airline! It has now been 8 weeks and no refund, no-one English to complain to and nowhere to go see someone about it. Regardless of the Airlines refund policy, Expedia should be refunding my money immediately as they didn't sell me what I paid for and I am owed a refund. At no time did I enter into an agreement with the airline or indeed even speak to the airline. You cant hold money from someone just because someone else hasn't paid you, and that's pretty much what they are doing. As far as I'm aware, that is illegal in the UK. I will never use them again and am contacting trading standards."

","Expedia.co.uk has never been known as a company which offers the cheapest deal, but I thought for the hassle of a few pounds I would just book through them.  I was looking for some California hotels and car hire for my pending trip.  Initially the person I spoke to about car hire was useless, clearly not a native English speaker and didn't know his stuff as he left me on hold until I hung up.  I decided to call back, but this time via the hotel bookings hotline and the service I received was wonderful.  The advisor on this hotline was a native English speaker and not only did he book my initial hotel, he also made suggestions on other hotels within my price range for the other cities I would be visiting on my US trip.  As the advisor knew I was in front of my computer with internet access, he made several hotel suggestions and urged me to look them up online.  In the end I also booked the car hire via him and he answered my questions straight away compared to his colleague who is supposed to be on the car hire side of the business who left me on hold.  During my trip I had to change my plans last minute and so called Expedia to see if they could arrange it for me.  Within minutes my new plans were accomodated for.  Even the inconvenience of needing to call the UK Expedia rather than the US hotline because I booked from the UK was overlooked by me because of this exceptional service I received.  Though Expedia still isn't the cheapest package holiday providers, or even offer the cheapest air fares, care hire etc, if there is only a few pounds difference I will certainly book through them again."

Worst Customer Service I have ever experienced! DO NOT USE THEM!!!
","I attempted to book a hotel room back in June via the Expedia.co.uk website, but I had some issue with the booking form. If I remember correctly there was not actually anywhere to put my Nectar card number, and the main reason I had decided to book with Expedia rather than other companies offering a similar rate was so that I could claim Nectar points - so I called. The operative I spoke to was clearly not a native English speaker and I found him difficult to converse with. At least twice during the call I asked him if he would like to take my Nectar card no. and he dismissed me. He then attempted to sign off the call without taking my Nectar no. and I had to prompt him again to do so. When I went to check out of the hotel I was charged extra for breakfast which I KNEW had been included on the original website listing. It took 3 days and 3 phonecalls (over 50 minutes in total - and twice they had promised to call me back and didn't) from myself to FINALLY get Expedia to admit their mistake and authorise a refund for the extra 40 euros I had to pay out - and then only because I had fortunately been able to recover a screen shot of the room listing on the website at the time I booked (and the fact that I asked to speak to a manager each time I called). Not to mention how long had to wait for the refund to actually go back into my account. Through the whole process I was made to feel that I was was in the wrong and had to jump through inordinate hoops to get the issue resolved. There was no apology for THEIR mistake or any offer of recompense for all the calls and hassle I had been through. Now I find that the Nectar points that were the original reason for me choosing Expedia have not even been credited to me!! I waited for over 30 days after the end of my trip as I was aware that it can take this long for them to appear. I called Nectar and was given a link to a form on Expedia's website where you can claim 'missing points' which I filled in on 5/9/14 (6 days ago). I received what appeared to be an automated email response telling me that 'The Nectar team has received your enquiry. Your points will be added to your account 30 days after your trip has been completed'. I waited 48hrs and then replied to this mail re-iterating the fact that it had ALREADY been far longer than 30 days - so why were my points not credited. That email was received and read the same day (ie 7th September - 4 days ago) and I have had no further response. I am astounded with the obvious incompetence of this company and can not believe how much time I am still wasting dealing with issues regarding a simple trip taken all the way back in June.If you value your sanity and your money DO NOT USE EXPEDIA.CO.UK!!!!"

Solving the unemployment problem in India but not for customers
","I booked a flight with expedia, when the confirmation came through it had the next days date on the flight and not what I'd booked. Contacted them within 8 hours. They sent it to the escalation department, I would hear in 72 hours. 96 hours, nothing. Rang them they sent another email to the escalations department and I would hear in 24 hours, nothing. Rang again was asked to hold on for 2 or 3 minutes, 15 minutes later he came back on the line said it had been investigated I had put in the date I thought but they wanted to reinvestigate, give them 24 hours, nothing. I rang again and found out I had spoken to 4 different call centres in India and all they could do was send an email, give them 24 hours, nothing. I emailed from the website, nothing. Emailed one of the managers at the email address found on a review, he was luckily on his vacation, not booked via expedia I imagine. So I sent an email to the person named on his auto reply and also sent the email back like it stated marked urgent, nothing. Emailed from the website again and just received an acknowledgement. Rang them, threatened to go to the press and got to speak to a manager, in the Indian call centre, who told me they had a snapshot of my booking and I booked the wrong date, so I did, as we were now over 2 weeks on paid to change the date of the flight, but asked for the proof, the snap shot to be sent to me, nothing. Rang again, nothing, and again, and guess what nothing. From what I was initially told by the rep who put me on hold for 15 minutes and the fact that the snap shot proof has not been sent to me, I am beginning to think I have been even more ripped off and conned and that I did in fact book the right date. This is the worst customer service I have ever come across. It is unbelievable that such a big firm doesn't allow customers to speak to the departments that actually make the decisions and only staff in Indian call centres who can only email. I'll never use expedia again and I will tell anyone who asks me or actually anyone who doesn't who I come across don't use expedia to book anything."

Appalling Customer Service
","We had booked to stay in a Pub through Expedia and were appalled at the state of the building when we arrived, it was nothing like the picture shown on the website, the walls were cracked the window pains rotten and the area was over grown and dirty, it looked like a derelict building. We tried to enter the pub only to find that the building was completely closed and there was no sign of life. We tried the doorbell and tried phoning but we had no response. By this point I was extremely upset as we had travelled a long distance and appeared to have no where to stay. After waiting for some time we drove aprrox 2 miles down the road into the centre of Wells as we had no choice but to try and find alternative accommodation. We ended up having to pay again to stay at an alternative hotel. I find the service (or should I say lack of) we have received completely unacceptable. We paid in good faith that the accomodation would be open and available and instead it was extremely distressing and we have paid for a service that we have not received. I have tried to contact Expedia Customer Service several times and have not received any response. I commented on the Expedia Facebook site in an aim to get a response and I was advised to phone their customer service number however when I did phone I was told that the customer service team are not available to speak to over the phone!!19th September 2014 - I am still yet to receive a response to my complaint, this really isn't good enough.

",Do not use this company!  I booked a hotel in Bruges through their website and received confirmation for dates NOT specified through booking process. Have called Expedia and wasted hours on the phone to be hung up on and issue still not resolved.  I am still awaiting a response from their investigation team and a full refund for the error that their website has made...I will never touch this company again. Their huge amount of marketing is a cover up for terrible customer service.

AVOID!!!!
","This company is a complete waste of time and money. I've had nothing but issues with them in regards to hotel bookings. I booked a USA holiday with them and had nothing but problems. One hotel even billed me $1762 because Expedia failed to pay them. After complaining and constant phone calls I finally got a ?100 credit (took 6 months though) foolishly I decided to use this voucher. I arrived at the hotel and there was no booking despite having the confirmation from Expedia. Expedia never booked the room with the hotel and I had to pay. The receptionist told me they have the same problem with Expedia all the time. I'm really sick of this company and I urge anyone I know that is planning a holiday to avoid them at all costs. Also it's just as cheap to boom with the hotel directly. So far from my word of mouth I've managed to take away approximately ?10,000 pounds worth of bookings away from Expedia. People that ignored my advice and booked with them wished they never did. PLEASE AVOID THIS COMPANY!!!"

Great service every time I have booked
","I have been using Expedia.co.uk for quite a number of years now and have never experienced a problem, I am shocked to read the upset of some customers experiences. Recently (1week ago) my family and I set off for a wk-end in Rome. The hotel had been booked through Expedia. Due to technical faults, our flight was cancelled and it became obvious pretty quick that we would not be going to Rome. I immediately made contact with Expedia who reassured me they would contact the hotel to request a refund. 2 days went by and I hadn't yet heard from Expedia, I wasn't overly worried as I know there is more than 'me' who needs attention so I made contact with them. It turns out the hotel had refused to give a refund (bad decision given the circumstances) and Expedia were doing their best to get the hotel to reconsider, I was asked to hold for what seemed an age when finally the customer service operator confirmed that Expedia would give us the full refund as the circumstances were not of our doing! In our opinion Expedia have dealt with us in an extremely attentive manner and have supported us from suffering further frustration. I will update this post when I receive the refund which should be in 5-7 days ( fair, to me) and hopefully can help to reinstate some of Expedia's fine reputation"

","Expedia are the worse company I have ever dealt with.  They took payments for my flights twice overcharging ?2000.  I only found out about their error when my bank cancelled all transactions on my bank account because I was massively overdrawn. I wasted a whole day ringing Expedia and had 3 very frustrating phone conversations, all they had to do was send a fax to my bank explaining their mistake.  Instead of sending the fax so that the money would go immediately back to my account Expedia wanted me to wait for 5 days, presumably so they could gain interest on my money.  I eventually persuaded my bank to cancel the duplicate payment.  I complained strongly and Expedia promised to ring me back and also promised me a ?25 voucher as a goodwill guesture, to date this has still not happened.  DO NOT BOOK WITH THEM customer service is non-existent, they refused to acknowledge their mistake and I did not even get an apology."

We decided to cancel the all trip as we didn't feel safe to travel with them. It 's now 3 weeks and we are still fightting to get our money back on the flight.

It was a complete waste of time as when the booking was made this information was not taken by the airline.

We did not have a good connection while at the resort and so when we arrived at the airport to return home and tried to check in there were no seats available for the family to sit together. We had to come back with only my wife and daughter sitting together. My 10 year old had to sit on his own."

It seems the staff are on some kind of payment structure which means they need to close calls down as fast as possible.

Con Artists! - Shame I can't give 0 star rating.
","We booked our flights through Expedia as they worked out a little cheaper than going direct to the British Airways website. It worked out around ?15 cheaper per person, so not a huge difference but it still helped our decision. I understand that when prices are advertised as much lower than the actual airlines website, it's going to be too good to be true! But I expected us to be safe with Expedia.After triple checking all our details we booked the flights, however, when the confirmation page appeared it said that we were travelling on a Sunday even though we had booked for a Monday.We called Expedia right away who said that our booking never went through, and since then (only 2 minutes!!) the prices had gone up by ?10 per person, I wasn't impressed but thought okay it still works out a littler cheaper. Then the guy on the phone said he couldn't process the booking for that cost and it would now be ?190 per person. This was more than BA were advertising direct! In the space of a few minutes the tickets had gone up by ?40 per person. Obviously this was just taking it too far so we cancelled the whole thing.I can't help but wonder what if we hadn't noticed their booking mistake, and thought it was normal that we didn?t receive a confirmation email. We would have turned up for our flights with no seats.The whole thing is such a con, they advertise a good price, they make a mistake, you call to rectify that, and they try to charge you a lot more money.Avoid at all costs, go direct through the airline, it may work out a little more expensive but it'll save you a lot of hassle!"

The next morning the hotel informed me that they were fully booked and that Expedia should be refunding me.After a few days I hadn't heard anything so I called Expedia who said they knew nothing about the refund, ok so this may have been a hotel problem but surely the two should communicate? After a lengthly conversation with Expedia, he basically advised me that it wasn't 'their fault' and that he could refund me but it would take 5-7 days. Considering they took the full balance within a few hours I was horrified that I would have to wait a week to get my ?300 back!!! This meant I could not take my children on the trip we had planned. So....8 days later STILL NO REFUND!!! When I requried a refund from booking.com this was processed overnight. Called them again, they claimed a technical error, I claim a lack of competence from staff and a ridiculous policy! I also wouldn't be surprised the last agent I spoke to 'accidently on purpose' forgot to process the refund correctly just because I dared to complain to him.Anyway, needless to say I will NEVER use Expedia again, neither will I recommend them and I travel a lot and make bookings through my work but never will I use Expedia.

Comparion on flights is misleading
",I booked a flight and hotel in Portugal using expedia that was straight forward. However when I went to the airline website a couple of weeks later to complete traveller details it became apparent that other than hand luggage no other lugage was inlcuded and I have to pay extra for this. Expedia claimed in their search results that this was the best priced flight but thats a lie as it is not comparable with other airlines that do include luggage. I rang Expedia and requested that their website should be clearer on this but they refused to accept this and said I should complete a form if I found a cheaper flight (which is ironic given they are meant to have done this already). When you look at this form it actually says you can only do this 48 hours after booking which the customer service representative would have known. They also have no where on their website to file a complaint (form to email them did not work) which shows you they are not interested.

Upon ringing back I was told it was against company policy to transfer me to the person I had just been speaking to even though his name was on the booking and I had just been speaking to him. It seemed a simple error to rectify to me but I had to be transferred to customer services who stated it would have to be escalated to a claim and the phone records listened to. Just speaking to the person who had just made the booking for me was not an option  -  and you won't find a name on any emails either!

When we booking there was NO mention of a deposit to be taken on arrival, once paid for there is a mention of a credit card required however no mention why or for what purpose, nor for what value.When we got to the Hertz desk we were told they wanted a massive ?1,500 deposit for the car. There are a few major issues here.NOWHERE does it say you will require a ?1,500 depositWe have already paid for insurance with yourselvesWe do not use credit cards and you took payment on a visa debit cardThe only mastercard we use (for security purposes) is a pre-paid one which definitely does not have a standing balance of ?1,500Most people renting a car will NOT have a available spare balance of ?1,500 on their card.By my investigation I can therefore conclude that you are 1) miss-marketing 2) providing incorrect information regarding fees 3) causing distress on what should be a simple transaction.What we ended up doing was renting a car from another company (Autovia) that cost 3 times the price, took half of our spending money and did not require a card.Because of you poor descriptions and failure to mention ?1,500 deposit required we were unable to take part in the excursions we planed on doing, therefore due to your mis-marketing we did not have the holiday we planned.I therefore want the following from you before I forward this on to trading standards."""

There was a language problem with the call when I booked and the call to transfer hotels, with the guy saying ""but you are already booked into the Stratford""!!  I spent the first hour of the weekend break trying to get through to Expedia but spent most of it on hold."

Over Pricing
","Absolute joke... I was looking for a hotel in Sa Coma Majorca for my son and girlfriend and decided that the Playa Dorada Aparthotel would be perfect as my parents had stayed there last year. On the Expedia website this hotel was priced at ?2,847 for a one all inclusive stay(this is a 3* hotel) On the hotel owns website site for the same wk and board it costs ?523??? I rang Expedia to ask such a price increase and the call handler was rude and thought it was actually funny telling me that it was the last room(which was a lie) and that if we could get it for ?523 then take It (really!!!). I can believe the increase? I told him were staying in a five star and it hadn't cost that. I will never ever use or recommend this company to anyone. Disgusting really!!!!"

","I booked and paid for a flight in January paying for my sons girlfriend to travel from the USA to London. Unfortunately due to a family problem she has had to cancel her trip so I tried contacting Expedia in order to cancel the booking, as I fully appreciate the difficulties it causes airlines with no shows.So I telephoned the customer help line and spoke to an operative in their Indian call centre who politely informed me I had to call the airline myself and make the cancelation. I challenged him on this as Expedia is the booking agent but he insisted this was the way forward. He then told me the telephone conversation was being recorded and then went onto to tell me I would be due a full refund. I clearly asked him to repeat this twice for the benefit of his tape recording which he confirmed twice.I was also informed one of the flights had been changed in March and that I had been e mailed this change. I had not had such an e mail and asked for a copy of it, which has not been forthcoming just a copy of their revised booking so I suspect it was never sent.I phoned the airline and they told me the cancelation had to be made by Expedia.So I called back Expedia and was told once again I had to call the airline. I called the airline again and yes you guessed it they said it had to come from Expedia.So I spoke with Expedia again this time I was kept waiting for over 30 minutes and got to speak to a manager. Once again I explained I wanted the booking cancelled and I asked how I would receive the refund as promised by the first person I spoke to. He then explained this was for the airline to determine and anyway as I had all ready been informed I would only get the tax back. He insisted I had been informed of this from the computer notes made by the first operator. I suggested he listen to the phone call as clearly this operators notes would appear to be incorrect. I therefore asked for a copy of the tape or a transcript but was told this would not be supplied under any circumstances.I am still awaiting formal confirmation by e mail that the booking has actually been cancelled. I have made a formal complaint and have been told it would be investigated by someone in London. So I asked for the London Office phone number so I could speak with them direct but the manager did not know it. It can bee looked up on Google it is 0207 019 2000.Until now I have used the service a lot and never had a problem.Come on Expedia you operator said I could have a full refund  that's a verbal contract its time to pay up or at least lets have the decency for someone to stand up and admit your errors."

By the time I'd been on the phone for 3 hours I told the latest person I'd been put through that I was contemplating suicide!!
","If I was to write a full review I'd probably be thinking in terms of something comparable to War and Peace in terms of length !! So I will make this relatively brief. I booked a Hotel in January in Wales for the weekend of the Heineken Cup final. I booked two rooms and was asked for two different names which I gave. All paid for at the same time . I received e mail confirmation from Expedia simultaneous with my booking. Subsequent to this I received around 6 further e mails from Expedia at various times alluding to the booking . Anyway this weekend (23/24 May 2014) I arrived at Hotel only to get to reception and for them to say they had not received anything from Expedia confirming my booking and the Hotel was full. I thought they must be joking ( but obviously weren't !)  anyway I spent the next hour trying to get through to someone at Expedia who could sort this out, eventually a woman said she had located a Hotel 5 mins away and booked two rooms there. We went to the other Hotel and went to reception gave them a quick appraisee and said they should have received confirmation from Expedia , the receptionist looked and said she had received confirmation for ONE room ONLY . So here we go again, I spend the next  TWO hours at reception on MY mobile trying to get through to someone at Expedia who could sort the latest problem out. At one point I'd been on the phone to someone for nearly one hour . Eventually the last person I spoke to said they had sorted it out and would e mail me on my iPad and also reception at the new Hotel, alas I received an e mail BUT reception didn't and would only be able to take confirmation if THEY received an e mail from Expedia at this point I was losing the will to live !! I then asked them to give me a room which I would pay for if the necessary confirmation didn't subsequently arrive. The moral to the story is if you ever book through a third party and EVEN if you DO receive confirmation of your booking STILL check with the venue ( or wherever) that THEY have received confirmation too otherwise you'll end up screwed!! Do NOT EVER book with Expedia again as the whole experience was painful and I wouldn't wish it on anyone. You know the IRONY was that on the e mails it said "" This booking cannot be cancelled and no refund can be given "" which is rich considering the technicality  they FORGOT TO BOOK MY TWO ROOMS in the first place!!!"

There must be others out there that have been trapped by this practice of misleading and deceiving customers. How can they still be operating???

","In April of 2013 my wife and I booked a flight for her parents to go back to their homeland, Madeira, for the New Year.Departing from London Heathrow on the 31 December 2013 and returning on the 11th January 2014.Two weeks prior to the departure date we attempted the on-line check in only to find that our flights had been cancelled.  We called Expedia who explained that flights were cancelled due to an overbooking of seats, and that a full refund and an email was sent to us in June.My wife and I are very busy and do not often check our emails, but we do not remember seeing anything from June.  However after searching we did find the email in our junk / spam folder.We were then advised by Expedia that there were seats available at that time but at a price ?269 more than we originally paid.  This we could not understand as our booking had been cancelled due to a lack of seats.  We requested to speak to a manager, who advised us that the error was with the airline, and that we should book the flights at the higher price and then claim a refund back from TAP Portugal.  After lengthy discussion with my wife, we decided that it was important for her parents to go back and see their family so we booked the flights at ?579, (original flights were ?310).  We subsequently called TAP to explain, but were told there was nothing they could do as the booking was with Expedia and we had to claim a refund from them.  They also advised that they were not responsible for cancelling our booking and that Expedia should provide us with a refund for the difference.We went back to Expedia, who have point blank refused to offer us any form of compensation or refund.  They have stated that as they sent us an email it was our fault.  We have spent days and days making phone call after phone call.  All the calls go out to India and you get passed from pillar to post.  You have to explain the details to every person you speak to, as nobody seems to pass any info on, and you just go round in circles.

Simply awful. Avoid like the plague.
","Expedia redefine unacceptable. How these people sleep at night is beyond me. For anyone reading the good reviews, ignore them as they are most likely fake. Here's just a few reasons that they should burn in hell:1. Paid more for the booking than the actual hotel walk in cost. 2. The pictured looked amazing - the reality was flies, bed bugs, hair and uncleared rooms - at three times the price of a motel.3. I booked a non smoking room. Instead of saying there were non left they booked me into a smoking room. The bellhop said this was common and gave me some disinfectant spray. WTF!4. Once booked the refundable booking instantly became un-refundable. I want to shoot them all in the head."

Shocking experience with Expedia for my hotel reservation
","I made a hotel reservation via Expedia for a night stay in Mercur Hotel Manchester, however, on my arrival I was told by the hotel no such a reservation and they couldn't give me a room to stay. When I phoned the customer services of Expedia about his, they were very unhelpful, after more than three hours waiting and many phone calls to them until the battery of my mobile run out, I was still not given a room either in that hotel or in an alternative one. In the end, I had to find another hotel myself for the night after all these exhausting phone calls.  When I got back home, I phoned Expedia again for a refund of my reservation, I was told that I had to write to their customer services to make a complain for the refund, which I did..... It took more than a month for their customer services to issue the refund, bad still, I did not see any apologetic words from their response for my ordeal. The best words I could find were ""I am glad that your correspondence was brought to my attention...."". I can't understand at all why he/she was so glad....."

We were not informed either at the point of booking/paying nor by email afterwards that there was an issue processing the payment and that the holiday was not, as a result, booked.Unsurprisingly, with the bank holiday weekend imminent, the hotel we'd chosen (and many others we were now forced to look at) was fully booked!Our holiday has ended up costing us double the initial price as we have been forced to pay up for a more expensive room/hotel.Expedia took absolutely no responsibility for their mistake and barely apologised.

Not only the website was not working but we were on the phone for an hour and had given all info when at the moment of payment the operator said 'oh, that fare is no longer available' it would be 300 pounds more now.

","I've used Expedia a lot over the years and until recently I'd fallen into the habit of not even checking elsewhere when booking flights. But I wouldn't recommend them anymore and am looking at the alternatives.They do quote some very attractive prices, but watch out for messages such as ""Your ticket price changed from ?329.35 to ?491.15. The airline could not confirm the original price due to pricing or availability changes that occurred after we posted the latest prices on our site. Continue booking or look for a different flight"".  I could understand that if the prices were back into sync a few hours later. But it seems to be systematic, trying to book again after a few hours or even  on another day and the same problem  comes up - a very attractive price that then goes up by about 50%.There is supposedly a phone option, but it switched from asking me to wait one minute to telling me that all their operators were busy, then repeated the ""all our operators are busy"" message without any gaps in until I just had to put the phone down.Then when you try and complain by email whenever you try to click on the email option it takes you through a menu of standard faqs rather than actually letting you send them an email."

","Booked a flight to Amsterdam to meet up with friends in May this year. Had to change outgoing flight to a later one. Was too expensive to change with existing provider having spoke to Expedia customer service, so said don't worry I'll book a separate outgoing flight with someone else as cheaper and return on my existing inbound flight.At no point did they tell me that if you do not check-in to existing outbound flight, even if you are not going to take it, do they cancel the WHOLE booking. Turns out I had no flight home. I found this out just before i was fly out and had to book another separate inbound flight. Ended up being a very expensive trip.Nowhere did it say anything about this issue, nor did they advise me of the implications. The last customer service person I spoke to on 03.05.13 I asked to escalate the compliant, which he said he would do and that I should expect a response within 7-10 days as they have to review the telephone calls.I have yet to hear.I have filled in TWO customer feedback questionnaires with Expedia - both explaining the issue - no feedback.They really are not concerned about customers.

I was charged by my bank interest on the expensive holiday until it was all sorted. The 6 weeks it carried on was very stressful and instead of sending me compensation for the bank charges they sent me ?150 voucher for Expedia - who I would never go with again! Suffice to say I never used it.3 years later and I messed up and stupidly thought it might be a one off (from looking at other online reviews I can see it is not!). I got sent an email to say I needed to add baggage to my flight (already done) I emailed three times (no response), I then called the customer service (call centre in India, very, very rude and unhelpful). They told me I needed to speak to Easyjet. I explained I had paid expedia and booked through them so I needed them to look into. The holiday was very expensive and adding baggage is only ?30 per person, you'd think they would say so sorry about this. We've called easyjet and modified your booking and you'll get an email confirmation later today. Instead all I've had is an email from easyjet - again saying I have no baggage. I will now have to email them direct.They make what should be something to look forward to really stressful. Don't book with them. For the sake of ?100-200 use someone else.

Ultimately, over many years, never been let down.
","I have booked flights and hotels all over Europe using Expedia.co.uk. In 2002 an online payment problem for a hotel in Italy was resolved when they called me and I was impressed. Recently a hotel in Portugal I was booked into shut down. I received an email asking me to contact Expedia Lodging Operations to confirm a change of hotel choice they were proposing. They gave two numbers, one in the US and an international one. Neither would connect from Skype. I rang their UK number and was told there was a problem and that they would call me back to save me hanging on the phone. Ten minutes later I received a call to my Russian mobile from the UK, was thanked for my patience and then transfered to the Lodging guys in the US who then ran through some options and left me with an appropriate alternative. The email confirmation arrived before I had finished the call.It seemed a bit long winded and at first I was a bit put out, as the reference number in the Lodging Ops email was different to the ref number in my booking from Expedia. Also, the contact numbers were not familiar. In the end though it was all genuine, the staff were, importantly, able to provide solutions at every step and were very polite.Over more than ten years, these are the only problems I can think of. Some flight options in Eastern Europe are not covered I've noticed and the same goes for hotels  which are not so western facing. I wish they'd connect up trains as well.Overall, a good place to start at the very least and of the most trust worthy I've encountered."

Watch out for their mistakes!
","I went to buy return flights to Vienna through Expedia. Simple you might think? I found the flights (via Munich with Lufthansa) and tried to book...got a message that my credit card had been refused. No booking notice, no tickets...since the credit card had been refused, I used another and booked the flights direct with Swiss. Job done - didn't think any more of it.Well, didn't think any more until I looked at my credit card statement. Invoice for ?305.25 from Lufthansa - what for I thought? Phone Lufthansa and they can't help me becuase I don't have a ticket or booking reference...because Expedia hadn't sent me anything. Call to my credit card company and I have to pay the amount and dispute it unless Expedia refund it...So, two calls to Expedia. First call reveals that they know about these flights but claim there were no charges and it is isn't them. Having done a full circuit of parties involved, I went back to Expedia armed with the reference from Lufthansa which was the e-ticket number. Suddenly Expedia can match those numbers up. The man on the end of the phone said ""I suppose we should refund you""...SUPPOSE?? As I stated, without pointing fingers, they were the party who enabled Lufthansa to take the money, so they have to be the company who will refund it. He found the exact amount, the exact date and then said that he would have to refer this to his manager and another team. Expect results within 48 hrs? So far, at 48 hrs...nothing at all. I hope for the best (refund) but have started the dispute process with credit card company.UPDATE - 23-5-13Thanks to Stuart Newman, this issue got escalated and the transaction was identified, reviewed and a refund is now being processed. The refund is split between Lufthansa and Expedia, so the lion's share has been processed - a good start. Thank you to Stuart for picking up the review, and making contact - great service!"

I really do like the Expedia service, but their are a couple of niggles that you can however overcome:
","Great website, lots of decent info, pictures etc etc. And good prices also, I really do like the company and use them all the time.HOWEVER;On a lot of the much discounted rates on 5* hotels particularly, if you book these with Expedia at their discount prices, from my experience anyway, I always find  I end up in the 1 room overlooking the brick wall of the kitchen or toilet area. I think that all the rooms offered at these prices are going to be the hotels weakest rooms,  BUT once at the hotel you can always ask for a different room and be moved to one of the normal rooms offered at normal rates overcoming this slight niggle.Also, a lot of the mega prices you might see on the Expedia site really do not hang around for long, so I would urge you to book immediately at that great price to avoid disappointment.Otherwise, all round great business."

I don't mean where you hold a reservation for days but literally if it takes a minute to fill in the details.

Been to Vegas the last 8 years and just booked to go to Florida next June can't say more than that believe me I don't  please easy but have no hesitation in using this company every time if the standard falls whould have no problem telling them but until that day will always book Expedia 10 out of 10.

The Best Website for Detailed Hotel Information and Flight Choices.
","I always use Expedia for detailed hotel info, every hotel featured has extensive bacground info. Not just the basics hotel facilities i.e. number of room, bars and restraunts but very detailed important things like, all the room and hotel  info, how far from local facilities and attractions, distance to the airport and  lots of photos and reviews to help you to decide.When you searce for a flight, either on its own or as part of a package, the variety of routes and airlines is vast and you have the option to narrow the search, by direct flights, airline and price.I would definatly recoment Expedia, especially to people un familiar to booking independantly from a high street travel agent, as the website make the process so easy with lots of different options and more importantly so much cheaper."

Good packages at good prices
","We've used Expedia (UK) for city breaks to go from London to New York (twice), to Toronto and to Washington as well as for an internal flight: Orlando to New York. The hotels have either met or exceded expectations. Prices, when compared, have been good, such that some of our trips were booked without seeking competitor prices. As we've never had a problem, I can't comment about after-sales, however if I have needed any pre-flight clarifications, telehone or e-mail contact has been fine. Our experiences have been good so I would have to recommend."

the worst company I ever trusted. SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE
","Unwilling to help me AT ALL, after selling me a useless 2000 $au travel package deal, when I found I was unable to get domestic flights on the dates they sold me the deal. Unbelievably terrible costumer service. Cannot recommend them to anyone, and I will certainly never make a booking with them ever again in my lifetime myself.No discount, no help, no promises kept when they told me they'd contact me they never did. This happened around three times.Had to take a loan to afford changing the dates, after having saved up for the trip as a waitress for four months. Still paying it off."

Good  (Most of the time)
","Have used Expedia several times now and most often everything has been fine.Usually use Expedia for arranging overnight stays in town as we live quite far out.Only once was there a problem (touch wood) Expedia got in touch to say that there were no rooms available at our chosen hotel, which was already booked.Staff were very insistent that we go to a different hotel, very stressful conversation with a lady in US who had no idea of the city we were going to and was reliant on a Google map! Eventually I broke off conversation with her and called hotel direct. Problem eventually solved.When customer services 'phoned me back from US and I told her everything fixed, she gave us a ?50 voucher as way of apology, we were happy.There had been a total mix up with the booking, problem with hotel plus problem with room. We had asked for a twin room, hotel offered us a bigger room, bigger bed, 2 duvets  - sorted!

when it's good it's very good but when it's bad it leaves wanting to kill yourself!!!!!
","One star due to customer service mainly.Positives.  Really good prices and easy to navigate website, but double check hotels with a variety of  customer review sites.  Easy to book, although the site sometimes seems to crash between taking payment and confirmation.  Check for the itinerary and it usually has gone through.Negatives.  Customer service is a total nightmare.  It costs a fortune to use, you need loads of spare time to hold on, and then you tend to get rude staff who clearly don't care about your problems and do little to fix them. They are often more interested in selling you stuff.   Lying seems to be common - they promise to take an action which does not happen. I am certain they are losing customers hand over fist as word about this issue spreads.  I know several people who won't use Expedia anymore due to this, and I am seriously thinking about joining them.  Nectar points.  I know you don't get much from Nectar points as you need hundreds to get anything decent, but this makes it more important that you get them when you are entitled to them.  EVERY time I have made a booking with Expedia I have had to call up to tell them that my request for points has failed on the booking page. Sometimes the points have been added, sometimes they haven't.  Do not let Nectar points be an incentive to use this site as you stand a good chance of not getting them."
1462,,4,2012-12-01T10:37:21.000+00:00,"
Would be 1st class if they made a few tweaks.
","I use Expedia a lot for both booking, trip planning and browsing prices. They are in my opinion the best site around, but I have grief over planning multi stop trips ( say like a road trips with multi hotel bookings and also flights). If the geeks who run the web site read this ( and I have asked them before) they could create a category on the front page that could handle multi flight/hotel bookings in a progressive manner.

When the airline altered their scheduling and we had to alter our plans they e-mailed asking me to contact them to discuss our options. The lady who I spoke to sounded less than interested in helping us and indeed offered alternatives that were not very satisfactory. On calling the airline direct it was confirmed that they were offering their customers a different option which sounded much better suited to our planned trip. On calling expedia to tell them this, they were able to offer the same alternative flights despite the first  lady saying she couldn't. We felt annoyed that we had to try so hard to get a satisfactory outcome but maybe it was just this one person who was not very good at their job.

","Booket one week accommodation in Rio de Janeiro through Expedia.co.uk. The write-up and information on the accommodation was excellent so we felt confident of an excellent time in Rio de Janeiro. My wife as pregnant at the time, so we wanted somewhere close to amenities and her Portuguese school in Ipanema.We arrived at the hotel to find that it was, in fact, a flat with two rooms that were let out to paying guests (and all this through Expedia!). Many of the hotel descriptions were false. There was no double bed, only a day bed with a pull out bed. No safe, dirt all around, no en suit facilities - had to share communal bathroom. Made a complaint to Expedia by phone shortly after arriving at the ""hotel"". They spoke to the owner while I was on the phone with them and advised that I should find alternativa accommodation in the middle of the night and with a pregnant wife!As we had chosen the ""hotel"" due to its location and convenience, we decided to stay there and await for our complaint to do the rounds inside Expedia and in hope of a refund.After over 30 days waiting, this is what we received from Expedia:' Reference Number: X114784111Thank you for choosing Expedia.co.uk Since receiving your complaint regarding the Ipanema Copa Rooms, I have contacted the property with regards to the issues you have raised. They have offered to change the rooms but you have declined this. With regards to this particular hotel, unlike our Expedia Special Rate Hotels, we do not have a room contract with the property and our website is used as a portal by the hotel to facilitate booking. This is why payment is taken by the hotel directly upon check-in/out. I regret that my response cannot be more favourable and hope that, despite your recent experience, you will continue to use Expedia.co.uk for your future travel arrangements, hereby allowing us the opportunity to restore your faith in our company. I trust our position in this regard has now been clarified.  Regards, Edgar Gorospe Jr.Tier 3 Senior Research SpecialistCustomer Relations Department for the U.K. and Ireland 'I am a very regular business traveller to Brazil and have almost always booked both hotel and flights through Expedia.co.uk, but I won't touch them again even with a barg pole. They are very happy to take your money, but will abandon and leave you high and dry and the first sign of problems. They are not to be trusted.You have been warned.Regards,George"

Have one problem and you'll never come back
","Booked a ticket which they couldn't deliver wile telling me refund will be no problems. 6 weeks later, I am still waiting for the refund. Their customer service is appalling: long wait, no clue, busy lines, the left hand doesn't know what the right hand does. I had booked tickets before with them and had never a problem but once you have to get in touch with the customer services.... it turns into a nightmare. I did an online search and they have an appalling reputation for customer services. Apparently, they have a 90 days refund policy.... I wish I has known before hand and that is why I take the time to write reviews. And I still have no clue when I will get a refund."

","No one should use Expedia for holiday booking purpose. First of all instead of taking advanced payments they have not secured my room in specified hotel.

fun trip now more stressful planned trip
","Just wanted to write & tell you all the stress I have been through with your company.  First of all I am a young student who is wanting to go to vegas for the 1st time with my roommate and we decided to book over expedia originally thinking it'd be easier. WOW WERE WE WRONG! Here's what has happened.  First tried to book online then it said to call a rep as there were problems with the flight. Then called and talk to (someone I could barely understand)who said he was unable to book flight and hotel together and tried to convince us to book just a hotel. Of course we said no as booking package deals are always cheaper!! (we are students, we are on a budget) So then we told him we'd call back. We then tried to book directly though the hotel with the package deal and had an email saying they'd contact us once the card went through.  Next morning found out are card BOUNCED!!We then found out our  EXPEDIA REP made 3 DIFFERENT apparently pre authorized payments on our card (we are using a DEBIT VISA) which actually TOOK OUT the money from my account, which caused a bounce in the package we wanted to book.  Called Expedia back, she said within 24 hrs it would go back into the account. Called back 30 hrs later where they told me now itd be 72 hrs until it would be in my account after already waiting 24! SO as you can imagine I am very upset as prices are constantly going up!!! not to mention the HOURS waiting on hold!  So after more waiting on hold and more calling one rep to another explaining my story and then back to my bank telling me it was expedia's job to take it off not there's! I have definitely had the most stressful week this summer!   After it all I now am dealing with an investigation which is going to take up to 30 days. WHICH MEANS, I will be short all that money that was taking out for my trip, plus now all the flights have gone up almost $100 more! I did manage to get a $200 credit from expedia but with my flight budget I am now short.   You think at least my originally booking price is what I should be paying, as none of this was my fault! I never authorized any payments taken out of my account or anything to be booked!   I now am forced to book with them and am very nervous to as I DO NOT want this to happen again or else my trip is definitely cancelled, as I am now $400 less than originally budgeted.   As both of us working in hospitality I feel that this company has done nothing but make me feel unwelcome! telling me it was my fault and that my bank had to do it. Not taking ANY responsibility to their staff making mistakes. It has now been 6 days & I still do not have this trip booked. I am stressing out that it wont happen & my once ""fun trip"" has turned into the trip I almost don't even want to go on anymore.     I would hope in the future if this was to ever happen to anyone else, they will deal with this way more efficiently and more apologetic. I suggest being able to talk to the SAME rep! from bouncing around, my experience was explained every time and I'm done telling it as it was not a good one. With my roommate being an avivid ""twitter""er she has made it aware that this company has been running us in circles all week. 500 followers are bound to make an impression.  That is all I wanted to say."

Over charged and passed around

I asked the staff to confirm the price was correct of ?37.50 which I was told was correct. The staff even checked the booking system and showed me that the price was ?37.50 I explained I had been charged ?50 to which the staff couldn't understand as the prices to Expedia are ?37.50. They told me I would have to chase it with Expedia direct. I spoke to customer services and they told me the price was ?50 to which I explained the hotel had shown me the booking system and the price was ?37.50. They tried to say it was local taxes ????? They kept me on hold for 45 mins and cut me off ? I tried ringing back to which I was on hold for yet another 15 mins which anyone answering, in the mean time while I was trying to ring them back they had left me a voicemail saying they were looking into it and I would be called back within an hour....... No call was returned. I went on the website to email a complaint, to which I received an email to say it would be looked into and I would be contacted within 24 hours, I have just received my contact, by email, stating they have passed it to another department and I will receive an answer within 28 working days, up to 6 weeks ???

Extremely poor customer service, I would not recommend Expedia to anyone.
","I used Expedia to book a return flights from London - Athens, Thira - London.  Unfortunately due to unforeseen circumstances I had to cancel the first leg of my journey and book through another airline, only because there were no suitable flights available through expedia to reschedule.  I understood that I would not be due a refund for the flight because I cancelled it, however I was advised that I was due a tax refund from the cancelled flight.On April 25 I was advised that I was due a ?40 tax refund and would receive this in 2 - 12 weeks.On May 29 I phoned requesting a status update on my refund to be advised that the airline had not received the refund application from Expedia.  Expedia reapplied for the tax refund with the airline and I was advised that I was due ?80, not ?40, and that I would receive this in 2 - 12 weeks.On July 2 I phoned requesting a status update on my refund and was advised that Expedia cannot apply for my tax refund until after I have completed the last leg of my flight in August and that it was a ?40, not ?80 refund and only then should I expect to receive it in 2 - 12 weeks.Expedia have not at any point contacted me to advise me of any problems with my refund, I have had to contact them and every time have been given incorrect advise.I have been advised to call them again in August after I have been on holiday to request, once again, that they apply for my refund and that I will have to wait another 2 - 12 weeks to receive the money owed to me.  If I ever receive the money rightfully owed to me I will have waited approximately 8 months for a ?40 or ?80 refund.I often use sites such as Budget Air, Expedia and Edreams and Expedia have by far given the worst customer service.I will never use Expedia again and would not recommend Expedia to anyone.Natasha"

When the confirmation came through, Expedia had booked all 4 of us into 1 room and one bed.  When we rang up Expedia blamed us for booking it incorrectly and refused to sort it out.  We had to ring TRADING STANDARDS to get advice and confirmation that we were in our rights, which we were, there was a website error.  Not our fault.  A further call which took over an hour and we still got nowhere with Expedia.  We put it in writing, giving them 7 days to sort it out.  Still nothing.  A further call and lots of being put on hold and being passed around and finally someone agreed to cancel the original hotel and book us into somewhere else BUT AT OUR EXPENSE.  This was their error and we had to suffer for it.  Expedia being the huge company that they are, would not budge to put things right that they had done wrong.  They preferred to blame us, Travelsupermarket, anyone but themselves who were responsible.  It would have taken them a couple of minutes to sort this out, but instead they were just awkard with us.Expedia, if you're reading this, you've lost all my future trade.

Appalling trip to Paris that ruined my New Year
","I booked a holiday to Paris over the New Year and was reassured before booking that it was in a lovely part of Paris, very central and connected to the public transport.On arrival at the airport in Paris after a very stressful journey to Manchester Airport I'd finally relaxed and decided to take the RER overground train to the station closest to my hotel. After horrified looks at the airport when asking for directions and being told not to leave at night I was pointed in the direction of 2 trains before I get to the station and a bus. Having lots of luggage we set about our way, got to the right station and waited for the right bus. We were in a deserted part of the City with nobody to help and after 2 hours of waiting for a bus the trains had finished so we couldn't head back the way we came, no taxi's in sight or numbers to call. I had to hitch a ride from an on duty policeman!! The hotel was miles away facing a cemetery fancy that view on New Years and the hotel reception staff spoke not a word of English, to add fuel to fire they decided to tell us we hadn't been booked in the hotel. After another 40 mins delay he finally let us in checking several registers. I have been to Paris before many times this was the worst experience ever! if I stayed out past 11pm there was no way I could get back to the Hotel which was miles away from the City and the Airport! I will never ever book through Expedia again! especially after lying about where the hotel was located!!"

After 50 minutes of this ping-pong match, expedia told me that they could not do the change because they had to change 4 letters: had it been 3, they could have done it! the only thing they proposed me was to buy another flight with them! of course, I didn't and when I rang again the customer service to ask for a refund, they answered that it was the responsiblity of lufthansa to change my name: basically they could have done it but no one was bothered and they just played the blame game!

Most recently I booked the hotel in New York through Expedia, having booked the flight direct with the airline. The Expedia service was just the same, and there were no issues with the hotel.

I deleted the cookies on my computer, and the price went back down again! Then when I pressed book now button, the price went up again. I booked online anyway, and having completed the entire process including entering credit card details and passenger info, the booking was rejected as the 'hotel was not available'. I rang Expedia customer service, and went through the entire booking process on the telephone again, only for it to be rejected as there was a problem with that particular hotel. Perhaps Expedia should stop advertising that deal if the hotel is not available... What a waste of time.

Never had a problem so far
","Over the last 5 year I have booked 5 DIY itenerary touring holidays to the states and Canada involving internal flights, trains, an average 8 different hotels and at least one car hire. Each has worked 100% and the flexibility has enabled me to see all the things I really wanted to see in both countries. I find it reasonably easy to use, always offers a wide selection of options and offers good value for money. Their secret hotel scheme is brilliant and offers real savings.For Transatlantic flights  I fly business class and book direct through the airlines customer web sites so I can book seats etc. and maximise my use of loyalty schemes."

Excellent Customer Support
",I have used Expedia many times and always found them helpful and efficient. Last September I had to cancel a hotel/flights booked holiday  for personal reasons and they refund all my hotel costs and flight costs less taxes in a matter of days with no quibble. I booked flights to USA for 2 weeks ago and due to the collapse of a Spanish airline the first leg was cancelled.  I was unaware of the collapse until arriving at the airport on the day of my flight.  I emailed Expedia customer support and very quickly I got the standard answers about claiming on holiday insurance or from my credit card company. I was not entirely happy about this as I needed to be in the USA for an arranged vacation so I telephoned the customer support number. I explained the problem and that I was calling from overseas. A charming young lady said she would look into the matter and promised to call me back. This she did and informed me she needed to speak to Air France who were chartering the flights. The office was closed but she said she would talk to them as soon as they opened. Later that afternoon she phoned to confirm she had organised 3 flights for the following day to get me to Indianapolis and my return flights would remain the same. This lady and her fellow workers provide me with an excellent service once again and for this reason I always use Expedia and recommend them to friends and family.

Great value and easy to use
",We've been booking holidays with Expedia for over 5 years now.  Sometimes I simply cannot believe the bargains I get!!  We have never had a bad hotel and one of the things I love is that if I do have a problem or a query I can actually ring a number and speak to a helpful person.  Not to be sneezed at in this day and age of websites with no phone numbers offered.  We tell everyone to use them.

Introduced changes to their system
","I have always used expedia and they often come through with the best prices (others can beat them once or twice but seem to come and go) and the system works very well. If I can't find what I want onscreen I phone them and most of the time get fairly competent people who can often fill in the gaps (.e.g need a flight 2 hours earlier for better connection time) and sometimes better the onscreen price by a little.However, yesterday I had a bad experience when I tried to book a flight where I could change the return date. I spoke to a salesperson who sold me a ticket on this basis but said the conditions only come up after the sale. I then hung on the line for support, who eventually agreed to cancel the sale as it was not changeable. They said there is now no way to see the conditions of the ticket until after it is booked (utterly ridiculous) - so I have decided not to use them until they sort this out. I also don't like having to pay premium rates for 40 minutes while they sort out this kind of thing. Meanwhile the credit card account with a wierd name that they used made my credit card issuer suspicious and so they blocked the account so I had to call home twice. What a pity to see a good company falling apart in such a competitive marketplace."

Customer service let's this company down
","We have been using Expedia for a number of years to book our holidays and the only problem experienced until last year was flights with one stop in USA where not enough time was allowed for retrieving luggage, security etc.  Last year we unfortunately had to cancel our holiday to Sarasota, as my mother died.  We contacted Expedia immediately and thought they were very helpful and sympathetic.  A few days later we received an email advising Expedia had contacted the airline and we would receive our refund within three cycles of our credit card. No mention of the hotel or car hire so we contacted them again.  This had been overlooked and it was duly processed and we received a refund for this part of the bill within a few days.  In November, while we were in Sarasota having re-booked, we received a refund for the original flights, one quarter of the actual cost after being told we would receive a full refund.  We contacted Expedia while in US and after much discussion we were advised the matter was closed as we had received a refund.  After speaking to a senior member of staff, we were informed the airline disputed the original claim as there was a name difference, the booking was made in my married name which I have had for 38 years.  On our return to UK, we sent a copy of our marraige certificate to Expedia who informed us they had sent it on to Virgin Atlantic.  We still haven't received our refund and its almost six months since we cancelled the holiday."

Used to be THE only company I would go with...now..not so much!
","For the past 6 years, I have booked EVERY trip with Expedia.  I have never had ANY complaint.  It has been easy to book, I got exactly what I wanted for a very reasonable price and everything ran smoothly.  This year we booked our holiday and a minor error was made on our part with the details of persons travelling.  Due to us getting married last year, my name had changed but I hadn't thought to change it on the Expedia account.  When booking the holiday, we just added the travellers that were already listed on our account, not thinking about the name change.  After booking, we realised the mistake and contacted Expedia to get the name changed.  I was shocked to find they were SO unhelpful, rude and unwilling to help.  We were told we would have to cancel the holiday, on which we would NOT get a refund and rebook the holiday in the correct name.  Therefore effectively pay for the holiday twice.  After MANY phone calls to Expedia over several days, they maintained this lack of customer service.  Therefore we contacted the airlines and hotels we were flying/staying with and explained the situation.  They ALL stated as far as they were concerned, they had no issue, just needed a copy of the marriage certificate and that would suffice.  They could not understand why Expedia were being so difficult.  This was explained to Expedia, but they still refused.  Therefore we had to go back to each and every airline and hotel and kindly request that they make contact with Expedia on our behalf and explain their view.  Ultimately, everything got sorted out and all we had to pay was the admin fee.  Subsequent trips, we have already booked with another company.  Expedia, you SERIOUSLY need to sort out your customer service.  Following this I should have only given you 1 star, but to be fair I have to give higher than that only because of my lack of complaints in previous years."

Reliable and Excellent Customer Service
","I have used Expedia to book a variety of trips to Europe and the States. Sometimes these have been hotel only deals and sometimes combined The quality has always been good and we have benefited from upgrades at hotels that I don't believe would have been available to people booking directly. On the occasions when we have had to use customer service, for example when flights were delayed or cancelled and we needed to inform hotels/ car hire companies that we would be late, the customer service people went to great trouble to sort things out for us and let us know that the arrangements had been changed.I would have no hesitation in recommending Expedia to others and look forward to our next trip."

I discovered Expedia offer a small incentive on the site and booked my last flight through them, thank goodness I did! Remember the closed airports of Winter 2010/11? Well, I was stuck in Hungary for 3 days but Expedia were absolutely amazing, free rebook on next available flight, keeping me informed and generally provided the reassurance of a 24/7 contact. Ever tried contacting an airline out of hours? Pointless, frustrating and impossible to get help direct from them but with Expedia all my problems were solved quickly and courteously, I will always use Expedia in future, highly recommended"

I use it a lot and I am very happy
","The problem I have with the site arose when I tried to book an hotel and flight to Malta and I couldn't get the flight to change to somethi ng I wanted. You tend to give ones that start at 6.30in the morning and that is just not on for a non car owner. In this instance I booked the flight I wanted through you with Air Malta and then added an hotel, but it didn't like it and I seemed to end with flight and hotel as seperate items and they were dearer than flight and hotel combined, which was annoying. I also think users should be aware that if Expedia has not hotels somewhere that does not mean the place is full - I went to Ushiaia, decided to sfay at the same place again - no luck and no luck elsewhere. But Ushiaia was empty when I got there and I was the only person in the hotel. I think one has to realise that if all the Expedia reservations have gone that does not mean all the rooms have gone. But for the rest I am very happy, although when I booked my Argentine stuff for this trip the customer reviews seemed to give me some pretty  wierd answers, I have stayed at some of the ones alleged to have bed bugs and sagging beds and things may have changed but they were OK once - and sometimes, when you look at the nationality of moaner and the price range you think they should get a life, because you usually get what you pays for."

A good starting point
",I nearly always start with expedia when I am constructing a holiday and most of the time I can get a good start. I find that car hire can be a bit hit and miss. It is shame that there is no option for rail travel instead of air. What I did find odd was when I had my flights cancelled due to the Iceland volcano problems in 2010 and I needed to get a refund I could not sort it out on line but had to 'phone; obviously everyone was callingand trying to sort things out and Expedia were overwhelmed; it took me 3 days to finally get through and start the ball rolling for my refund. Why when you can do all your booking on line can you not apply for a refund of a cancelled flight? However the good definitely outweighs the niggles.

When I emailed customer services they said I had to call them instead.  With no help/info from Expedia I had to reorganise the flights myself.

A good place to start
","Expedia provide a good place to start planning a trip with their vast array of choices. I have always found that the deals they offer stand up well to to those that I can put together myself or are offered by tour operators; plus there's less risk involved than doing everything independently. So why look anywhere else? Well, for me there's always the destination where Expedia's packages don't quite fit. The airport's not that near to the resort, or the car on offer isn't quite what's needed to transport the skis, boots and normal baggage between the airport an the accommodation. Then there's also the nature of the accommodation. For a hotel or an apartment complex Expedia is fine; for individual holiday flats or houses then there's a lot more out there!"

",Have used Expedia several times to book trips and has always been satisfactory. Would like to be able to book online flight and hotels in more than one location e.g. one night at airport hotel on arrival +/- departure and one or more different hotels in locations further from airport. Would also like more flexibility when searching flights to allow viewing of a few dates either side of selected date. Will continue to use Expedia as find it the best in comparison with similar sites.

","My holiday in January 2012 was booked via Expedia on line. I found the site easy to operate and was very pleased with my trip. I had stayed at the hotel (Sol Principe - Torremolinos) a feew times before so knew what to expect. One thing expedia did for me that other operaters had previously omitted was to pre-book my luggage, which saved me a phone call and the cost was included in the price.Excellent value on this occasion and I will look to them for booking my next holiday.I was well chuffed with everything."

Not always the cheapest, but customer service is fine
","I almost always use Expedia as my travel agent when planning a trip. It is easy to use the website and it is fast and convenient.Pricing is not always the lowest, so it pays to check elsewhere before booking. Car  hire, for example, is often cheaper on Holiday Autos.  Hotel rooms can be booked for less by going direct to the hotel or using a scraper service such as Kayak.Flights are not always good value, either.  However, I have used Expedia to book many long-haul trips, hotels and cars because of the good customer service.Once, when in China, there was a problem with one hotel. A phone call to Expedia sorted out the difficulty.  Another time in Thailand, the hotel claimed not to have received the Expedia booking. Again, a phone call with Expedia resolved the problem (the hotel was scamming me).A word of caution; you will often not be credited with frequent flier miles if you book a hotel using Expedia."

","Expedia proved invaluable last year when we found that an airline had cancelled our flight, when we had already travelled part of the way home.  Because all our tickets had been booked together, we were put into a hotel, then a later flight, which then missed the last flight, and we were afforded another hotel room for the second night.  After such a weary journey, we were glad we had not booked all our flights separately, as we were tired and hungry, and goodness knows where we would have wound up."

They have always treated me brilliantly; for example, during the volcanic ash cloud in 2010 when the airline I was due to travel with cancelled my flight, Expedia refunded the entire cost of my holiday immediately without fuss. The only reason I have deducted a star from my rating is that I have sometimes found it difficult to get through to an advisor, in some cases waiting on the phone for what seems like ages. Other than that, once you get to speak to someone they are a great company to deal with and I definitely recommend them for all holiday travel requirements."

They are due to refund me my money from the flight and allowed me to cancel my hotel without a problem. Superb, was not expecting it.

Gave False Information Upon Booking
","I booked 4 internal flights in the USA to be taken in November 2011.Because the web site was very confusing regarding the cost of luggage,(which it did make clear was not included in the flight cost) I called to make my booking.The Expedia agent checked with American Airlines for me, and told me our bags would be ?9 per bag. I explained we had one bag each and two sets of golf clubs, and he confirmed we would definitely be charged 6 x ?9, i.e. a total of ?54. He further told me that when I booked the flights I would receive a link with my e mail flight confirmation, which would take me to the  American Airlines site where I could pay for the luggage. There was no link with the confirmation, so I contacted AA separately to find the cost of each bag was $25, which is almost ?16, and the golf clubs were $35, just over ?22. Accordingly our luggage bill was around ?54 more expensive than quoted.I called to complain about this but nobody would take resonsibility, they just kept offering to cancel the flights and give me a refund, which was no good because I needed those flights. I sent several e mails which were ignored completely, until I threatened to complain widely, which prompted a response. I was EVENTUALLY told that they would honour the ?9 quote and I could claim the difference back after the holiday.This I have attempted to do. The first two e mails were ignored, the third was answered telling me to send in the receipts for the luggage. I had already told them I had no receipts because it was all done on line and paperless. I offered to send in a copy of my credit card statement, and I received another response (3 weeks later)  telling me to send the copy statement. It was a two line e mail and did not give me any information at all about where to send the bill, and their web site does not help at all, so on 5th January I e mailed back asking for these details. It's 1st February today, and guess what, no response yet.I took a matter of minutes for them to take my money for the flights and dispatch incorrect information. There were other companies about the same price for the flights, but taking the total quote, bags included, there was not much in it, so I booked with Expedia. Had I know the true cost of the bags, i would have not booked with them.In summary: Great at taking your money, but they don't want to know if they have to give any out. Like many large companies, it seems if they ignore the little person, they might go away. ALWAYS CONFIRM WHAT THEY QUOTE BEFORE BOOKING."

Great prices and easy to use
","I have used Expedia for the last 4 years to book holidays to the USA. Everything I have booked has been as advertised. I always shop around to get the best deals and this one comes up trumps all the time for me, especially when booking flights and hotels together as they give you a discount. I also use my company employee benefits website which provides a link to Expedia and a further discount. The website is easy to use, much easier than most others and last year I think they noticed I hadn't booked up as early as normal, so to get my business they gave me a ?100 discount voucher, I was sold, and the holiday was booked shortly after. Normally I've booked up by now but I'm just holding off a wee while longer to see if I get that nice discount voucher offered to me again...fingers crossed :-)"

""Great to book online but call centre is a let down""
","I have two holidays with this company and the first one was a breeze. Las Vegas trip worked out cheap compared to the deals I was getting during the time. Recently I booked two days break for Dublin and that experience was interesting. I checked the details online and was about to book online. As we were a party of six I decided to call up the call centre. I got through to an overseas call centre and managed to find the deal I was looking for. I explained to the agent that we were a party of 6 and the money will be paid on two cards. I admit that agent was very accommodating and explained the first card payment will be 70 % of the total and the second will be 30 %. I informed her that I am not happy with this and she agreed that it will be fine to pay for 4 people on one card and 2 on the other. All prices and flight times were agreed and booking continued. When it came to processing payment whatever I explained about paying for 4 people on one card went out of the window. She quoted 70% of the charge. As we were back to square one I explained what I wanted again. Agent informed me that it should be done as 2 booking. Once the second booking was created we carried on with the payment. Before processing the payment the agent informed me the amount she will be deducting of the card and asked my permission. I agreed as everything was correct. I was waiting for the first payment to be processed she came back on the phone and informed me that the prices have gone up. I was a bit confused and questioned it. The agent informed me that she works on a live system and prices can change. I informed her that I am not happy about this as you were just about to take payment for a agreed amount. She informed me that there is nothing she can do and even a manager cant help. I informed her that I was disappointed with the service but "" I cant do anything was the reply"". I was not happy about this so I decided to book it via Expedia website. I found that the rates were the same as before and nothing different. While entering the details of the passenger I noticed that the agent had spelt one of the passengers name wrong which I was not happy about as this would have coasted us more if it needed to be changed later. I entered correct information and continued with the booking. Once the booking was at payment page. The price changed and came to the amount agent mentioned on the phone. I noticed that the difference in price was only ?5 per person which the agent failed to mention. On the positive side we didn't end up paying extra to change passenger spelling. Personally I feel that they should have adjusted the fluxuating rate after the price was agreed which would have been the real Expedia experience ( they would have gained that additional 2 stars)PositiveEasy to use website, Good Deals, No Credit Card Charge.NegativeOverseas call centre was a let down both on quality and service. Rates can fluxuate so until last minute you wont know how much you are paying."

It's a really useful site and i always refer to it before booking any holiday.The only small pitfall is some of the reviews posted aren't always helpful so it can be tricky to establish whether the reviewer was expecting more for there money as opposed to value for money.

Good points, bad points....
","I have used Expedia time and again to travel and for the most part they are excellent value for money. I love the way you can book what you need to with regards to accommodation, car and flight - bolting them on or taking them off as you wish. They used to be the cheapest but lately other companies are giving them a run for their money with regards to price. When you book up it is very simple and the website is easy to use and navigate. I don't like the fact that if you have an issue or perhaps special requirements you can't fulfill online you have to ring a premium number though.Once when we were away we had problems with the hotel we booked not being what it said it was in a place in Cincinnati, OH that was undesirable.In fact during our stay on New Year's Eve someone got shot dead in our hotel foyer as we slept. I think that perhaps Expedia have got so big now that they lack the attention to detail that is sometimes needed. I fully expect that every hotel they willingly sell should be fully previewed by themselves before allowing their customers to stay there. For that reason, the fact they aren't as cheap anymore, and the premium customer support I have to give Expedia a three star."

Curate's Egg; good in parts
","During a long vacation in North-West USA the hotel booking systems were flawless. The hotels less so. Rooms were often 'also ran' despite bookings placed six months in advance. Local negotiation by other 'off the street' customers gave them better (quieter, more spacious, better appointed) rooms. Use with care."

Expedia constantly changing prices
","It takes a while to search and select flights... so it's kind of lame that once you are about to buy, the prices suddenly jump up, sometimes they final prices work out to be even 200% more expensive than the initial quote. I was thinking what's the point? They are wasting my time and then I realised they are trying to take advantage of the people that have already dreamt of a particular holiday they found on the site, and want it so badly that sometimes they might finally go ahead and book it at the much higher price...Lame marketing practices, I am a bit worried that these guys have bought Tripadvisor... I hope they leave Tripadvisor as it is, independent and reliable and not use it for their own purposes."

Avoid if you can.
","Pros:Excellent online booking engine, very easy ordering processSometimes they offer cheaper rates than other sites.One of only a few sites that allows you to book multi city flights.Cons:Customer service is terrible - they are not really geared towards frequent travellers with complex itineraries so when things go wrong or you need to make last minute changes to your plans don't expect much help from expedia.When you do finally get through to their customer service agents they are very difficult to understand due to their strong accents and they read everything from a script, it feels like you are conversing with a computer. If you are a frequent flyer and need them to take care of communicating your membership numbers, seat preferences etc. to the airline  - forget it, despite several phonecalls to get expedia to process my SAS Eurobonus number properly on my flight bookings, they still haven't managed to work it out.  Another very annoying issue is they take around 3-6 months to process a refund if you have to cancel a ticket - this is very naughty and they tend to hold on to your money until you chase it - my impression is if you don't keep asking them for the refund, you will never get it.It seems that they put 100% of their customer service effort into the initial ordering process and they don't really give a damn once you have paid.Due to these problems, I have stopped using expedia for travel bookings, which is a shame because I like their website and booking engine."

Suddenly i don't miss Zoom just as much
","Nothing makes a man's heart palpitate as much as the words "" honey, lets book a flight and see........) The cold sweats of online trawling for countless airline companies, who each have their own agenda, the British Airways's and Emirates' who will not use flight search companies, the slog to the retail flight centres to be amused by their prices...... and the list goes on.Enter Expedia. the dot C A version i might add. Yes, they too suffer from the elitist airlines who do not want to surrender seats at a reduced cost, but rarely, and i mean rarely, in the past year, have i seen expedia beaten. Yes they did tend to be kicked to second best by a certain american flight company, but since early 2010, they have came back with a vengeance.as for the actual expedia experience, i find it quick, easy and reliable. Three keystones of a good flight. Secured payments and a profile work wonders for grumpy old men who loathe having to re-enter family members time after time again. The itinerary email that doesnt need 12 pages to print is also very appreciated. and whoa - whats this - a unique code to check the status of your flight from anywhere? Outstanding. Like i say, if i can book on expedia and not need a shot of whiskey, I am having a good time.Now, my only slightly comment would be more directed towards AirCanada than expedia. Why do you not honour the seat allocation booked through expedia?? for those of you who are wondering what i am talking about, I always try and search out a good seat on a flight, and this past Christmas, i was pleased to have found good seats. When i got my tickets at the terminal to fly, guess what. I had been moved. I admit at 6'2"" i am not the biggest guy on a flight, but for someone like me, who isnt built like a summer reed, a middle seat in the middle row of a transatlantic flight isnt enthralling. But, i got to fly when Heathrow airport folded under a centimetre of snow so no complaints really.Back to the task in hand, do i recommend expedia? Absolutely yes. Do i recommend taking the price you get from expedia and looking online further? absolutely yes. But like me, 9 out of 10 times, you will be back to Expedia. and in March, I am hoping to book my first expedia vacation to Vegas so stay tuned...."
