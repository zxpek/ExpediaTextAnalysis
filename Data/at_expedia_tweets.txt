@ExpediaUK Last tweet should have read, 'I *can't* see how I'm the only person affected'. I have no need to follow up with you now. I've done it direct
@ExpediaUK Thanks but I've just spend an hour+ with them sorting it.  I can see how I'm the only person affected though. Booked an infant in own seat.
@ExpediaUK I booked a holiday thru you, flying @ryanair. Your system booked my infant son as a 'child'. FYI,this breaks their online checkin
@ExpediaUK Sent! X
@ExpediaUK Thanks. I've just sent you a DM. It'd be great if you could help
@ExpediaUK could you please follow me so I can send you a DM? Thanks

@ExpediaUK absolute con artists. Booked hire car and got totally screwed over at the airport in Spain and ended up paying double. Rip off!!!
@ExpediaUK hi, I've been trying to make a hotel booking but it keeps getting stuck on this screen. I'm using Safari on MacBook if that helps https://t.co/rxusD2zHvc
@ExpediaUK Is something wrong with your website? I've tried twice now and payment has gotten stuck at "We're confirming your booking..."
@ExpediaUK Thank you, appreciate the help from your and your colleagues.
@ExpediaUK @Expedia Have followed, and thanks, I didn't think to check for a country specific twitter account when I reached out.
@ExpediaUK hi got told nectar points would be on my account within 35 days and it's been over and I haven't had them out on yet?
@ExpediaUK I'm in UK &amp; need to log into USA Expedia account since my bookings aren't showing. How can I do this/ stop the website redirect?
@ExpediaUK Tried that, after being on hold for 20 minutes. I was told to book directly with the airline as there was no problem your end, sad times!

@ExpediaUK Your site is a nightmare, all my details are correct &amp; I still cant book, extremely disappointed, going somewhere else!
@ExpediaUK Spent  2 hours on phone to get no where. Your internet booking is a nightmare. Happy for you to dm me as it won't let me dm you
@ExpediaUK @trover #TakeAHike up a gloriously misty mean hill in our Lake District, England. The views were breathtaking [?] https://t.co/HhgKBKRKNQ
@ExpediaUK @trover We certainly took a hike to get to this beautiful location #takeahike https://t.co/3kzE5OZhcV
@ExpediaUK It wasn't the price change that irritated me, it was the order form not allowing me to process payment. I've gone elsewhere due to your piss
@ExpediaUK @trover #takeahike Goat trekking in Norway! https://t.co/2f3gnbCtbv
@ExpediaUK I understand how it works. So you don't confirm to Quidco whether the referral link for transactions comes from their website?
@ExpediaUK Yes I understand how it works. They have advised that you have declined it... https://t.co/hekusOPFZy
@ExpediaUK You charged me PS4k to book a hotel that turned out not to exist 2 months ago &amp; I still have had no refund despite hours of calls.
@ExpediaUK is having a shocker handling my customer service issue! Incredibly frustrating and seriously questioning ever using again.

@ExpediaUK Hi. Tried booking holiday on site &amp; transaction failed x2 but money has been taken from account for same holiday x2 nearly PS2000!
@ExpediaUK Tried that. Got passed around. Explained the issue numerous times. Assured it would be sorted and someone would get back to me. Nothing.
@ExpediaUK @Expedia Many thanks to Rahul for his assistance with my itinerary with @qatarairways  &amp; Tokyu Stay Gotanda Hotel #Phew! 
@ExpediaUK Here's our complaint reference number, you should have everything on record with that. Please sort this.

@ExpediaUK you have lost my paid booking, call centre not helping, can I speak to UK based advisor? I've been transferred everywhere already
@ExpediaUK you guys having issues with your site? Keep getting errors while trying to book
@ExpediaUK @ladies_leisure I was advised by Expedia to cancel a booking and re book it. Short of PS767.52 after two weeks. Ref 727866080445
@ExpediaUK just arrived in Thailand. booked 2 rooms. and they have crammed 5 ppl onto 1 room. paid for 2. please help it's 0339am here
@ExpediaUK JOKE!!! Taking money from my account when shouldn't and everyone I speak to has a different answer about refund !!!!!
@ExpediaUK booked a transfer that didn't confirm pick up. #Expedia said book alternative &amp; claim refund. Now refusing refund! Awful service!
@ExpediaUK ^RC email is johnh111003@btinternet.com basically booked double bed got twin singles hotel said their bookings took preference, not happy
@ExpediaUK Or......you could process the refund yourself and leave me out of the dispute with the hotel?
@ExpediaUK lost the flight so booking elsewhere
@ExpediaUK Been trying to pay fopr 10 minutes and it just says can't complete try again. Pretty useless message
@ExpediaUK advertise 1 thing confirm another false advertising. Poor customer service, issue with your website but wont admit your at fault
@ExpediaUK false advertising of car rental, that is illegal and against trades description act. Travel Yourself Interesting,not with Expedia
@ExpediaUK what a disgraceful company you are! I booked a 5 passenger car taking two bags and you acknowledge a 4 passenger which takes 1bag https://t.co/nic11msrDz
@ExpediaUK I am still waiting for you to call me back. I was told I was on an urgent list &amp;would be called within 48hours. That was a wk ago
@ExpediaUK Thanks for your prompt reply. DM just sent.
@ExpediaUK Having a howler trying to get a response from you re: a trip cancelled by local operator. Unimpressed with your customer support.
@ExpediaUK Thanks. I'll forward you the correspondence and DM you now. I can't believe he works for Expedia, his emails are harassing!
@ExpediaUK Harassing and rude emails from your call centre threatening to cancel holiday. Who can I escalate to? He says I can't!
@ExpediaUK Hello, does "collected by hotel" on my confirmation email mean payment hasn't been taken by Exped and I need to pay at the hotel?
@ExpediaUK hello, can you please provide me with your uk customer service email for hotel complaints? Extremely urgent!
@ExpediaUK I have replied by inbox but it is fairly urgent. Please get back to me asap
@ExpediaUK @Expedia I need someone to call me back so this issue can be resolved, I'm tired of being put on hold for hours
@ExpediaUK you need new customer service reps because I've never received such horrible service from a booking company
